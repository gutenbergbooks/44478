<p>The author of the Dare Boys is specially equipped
through long study and research to write upon the
life and adventures of the revolutionary period.
Every item of historical reference is absolutely correct.
The trials and inherent bravery of the sturdy
warriors of this epoch are always subjects worth
while, but here the dash and bravery of the two
Dare boys adds immeasurably to the interest.</p>

<h1 class='nobreak' id='t79'>CHAPTER I—In Virginia</h1>

<p>“Well, here we are in Virginia,” said
Tom Dare. “It is fine, don’t you fellows
think? When we left New York, it was
cold, with heavy snow on the ground, while here,
instead of snow, there are patches of green grass
and the weather is warm and nice.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is lots more pleasant here than in
New York at this time of the year,” agreed Ben
Foster.</p>

<p>“Yes, camp life is much more agreeable in a
warm climate than in a region where there is
snow and cold weather,” acquiesced Dick Dare.</p>

<p>It was now the middle of the month of December
of the year 1780, and the patriot regiment
under the command of Colonel Morris had been
sent down from the vicinity of New York, by
General Washington, to try to hold in check the
army of General Arnold, the traitor, who, having
tried to deliver his country into the hands
of the British, for gold, and failed, had been sent
to Virginia, to have charge of the British campaign
in that State.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for sending Arnold down
there was to get him far enough away from General
Washington, so that there would not be much
danger of his being captured, an attempt to capture
him while he was in New York having been
made, but without success.</p>

<p>In Colonel Morris’ regiment, and among the
members of the company commanded by Captain
Morgan, were three youths of about twenty
years, who had done good work for the patriot
cause during the years they had been in the patriot
army. These youths were Dick and Tom
Dare, brothers, and Ben Foster, a neighbor
boy--the Dares and Fosters living close together, in
New Jersey, a few miles east of Philadelphia--and
now that they were here in Virginia, they
looked forward to a lively campaign, for the
warm, pleasant weather, so different from what
they had left up North, would make it possible to
move swiftly about the country.</p>

<p>The regiment had gone into camp on the bank
of a little stream in the heavy woods, perhaps ten
miles from the James River. Colonel Morris
did not know the whereabouts of Arnold and his
army, but liking this site for an encampment, he
had decided to stay till he gained the necessary
information.</p>

<p>When we introduce the Dare Boys and Ben
Foster to the reader’s notice, it is evening, and
the soldiers are engaged in cooking their suppers
beside the campfires. It was a lively, picturesque
and interesting scene indeed, or would have so
looked to anyone viewing such a scene for the
first time. But to the soldiers, who had been
campaigning four years, no thought of their appearance
came to them. Their minds were on
the then very essential matter of cooking their
supper.</p>

<p>This important task finished finally, the soldiers
ate heartily, and then, as was their wont,
settled down to enjoy themselves. Those who
smoked lighted their pipes, while others sat about
in groups and talked of the coming campaign,
in which they hoped to be able to make it hot
for the traitor, Arnold, and his army of British
soldiers and Tories.</p>

<p>Dick, Tom and Ben, and some of the other
soldiers, among whom were Tim Murphy and
Fritz Schmockenburg, sat in a little group and
talked earnestly of their expected encounters with
Arnold and his little army, and all were pleased
with the outlook. They liked what they had
seen of Virginia, and were glad they had come
to the South, where suffering from the cold was
not a necessary concomitant of camp life.</p>

<p>“I like id down here,” said Fritz, nodding
decidedly. “I hobe dot ve sday down here till
der war is ended alretty.”</p>

<p>“Sure an’ thot would suit me, too,” said Tim.
“Oi’m t’inkin’ thot Virginia is good enough for
me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where Arnold’s army is,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“That is what everybody is wondering, I
guess,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick. “We know that Arnold is
somewhere in this part of Virginia, but he may
be a hundred miles from this spot.”</p>

<p>“Well, when we find out where he is, we’ll
make it hot for him,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is vot ve vill do,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>They continued to talk quite a while, and finally
got out their blankets, lay down and were soon
sound asleep. They slept splendidly till morning,
and then cooked and ate their breakfast, after
which for exercise they walked about for a while;
of course within the bounds of the camp, after
which they again sat down to talk.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, an orderly from Colonel
Morris’ tent appeared, and said to Dick Dare:</p>

<p>“You are wanted at the headquarters tent,
Dick Dare.”</p>

<p>“All right,” the youth replied. “I’ll go along
with you.” He got up and accompanied the orderly,
and was soon standing in the tent, in the
presence of Colonel Morris.</p>

<p>“Dick Dare,” said the colonel, looking at the
youth earnestly, “we are desirous of learning the
whereabouts of Arnold’s army, and so I have
summoned you to tell you that I want you to go
in search of Arnold’s encampment.”</p>

<p>Dick’s face lighted up. This was just the kind
of work he liked. He had done much of scouting
and spying for General Washington, and he
was always glad to be sent on work of this
kind.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to go and search for Arnold’s
encampment, sir,” he said. “When shall I
start?”</p>

<p>“As soon as you can get ready. I am eager
to get Arnold located. Then I can begin my
campaign against him.”</p>

<p>“I will start at once, sir. Have you any instructions
to give?”</p>

<p>“None, except to say, find Arnold.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. If there is nothing else you
wish to say, I will go.”</p>

<p>“That is all, Dick. Find Arnold, and then report
to me as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best, sir.” Then Dick saluted
and withdrew, and hastened back to the point
where his comrades were. The moment they
caught sight of his glowing face, they uttered
exclamations.</p>

<p>“You are going in search of Arnold’s army,
I’ll wager!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is vot he is goin’ to do,” nodded
Fritz.</p>

<p>“Av coorse,” said Tim. “He’s the bye thot
can foind Arnold, av innywan can.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going in search of Arnold’s army,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“Say, I’m going with you,” said Tom, decidedly.</p>

<p>“And so am I,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“The three of us can spread out and cover a
lot more ground than one person can,” said Tom.
“We’re going with you, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick looked at them thoughtfully. “I guess
you are right about that,” he said, presently.
“Yes, I’ll take you two chaps along.”</p>

<p>“Say, why not take Dootchy an’ mesilf wid
ye, Dick?” exclaimed Tim, who would have liked
immensely to have gone with the three youths.</p>

<p>“That would be too many, Tim,” was the reply.
“No, just Tom, Ben and myself will go.”</p>

<p>Dick went and reported to Captain Morgan,
and was granted permission to take Tom and
Ben with him, and a few minutes later the three
left the encampment, followed by wishes for
good luck from their comrades. They set out
in the direction that they thought might lead toward
the encampment of Arnold.</p>

<p>They walked at a moderate pace, and kept a
sharp lookout around them, for they did not
know but they might happen upon redcoats anywhere.
And there might be parties of Tories in
that part of the country.</p>

<p>They kept onward till noon, however, and had
not seen any redcoats. They had seen only three
houses in that time, and although they made
inquiries at the houses, they did not learn of the
presence anywhere in that part of the country of
the British.</p>

<p>They ate a cold bite for luncheon, and then
rested a while, and discussed the matter that had
brought them into the wilderness, trying to figure
out which direction was most likely to lead them
to Arnold, and finally they got up and set out
again.</p>

<p>They kept on going till about the middle of the
afternoon, and then they came to the top of a
ridge. It was covered with trees--in fact, they
had been traveling through the timber pretty
much ever since leaving camp--and here they
paused, looking down the slope at the other side
of the ridge.</p>

<p>At first, they saw nothing unusual, then suddenly
an exclamation escaped the lips of Dick,
and pointing his finger, he said in a low voice:
“See yonder, boys.”</p>

<p>Tom and Ben looked in the direction indicated,
and Tom said, excitedly: “Sure as living, a
party of redcoats!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick. “Be careful, boys, and
don’t let them see you. Get slowly behind
trees.”</p>

<p>They took up their stations as suggested, and
after a few minutes Dick said: “I’m going to
slip down there, get within hearing distance of
those fellows, if I can, and learn what they are
doing here.”</p>

<p>“Look out that they don’t see and capture you,
Dick,” cautioned Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” was the reply. Then, telling
the two to remain there, Dick set out on his perilous
expedition.</p>

<p>He was careful to keep trees between himself
and the redcoats, and as he was skilled at this
kind of work, he managed to reach a point within
hearing distance of the redcoats as they sat talking,
then stationed behind a tree, Dick stood there,
listening intently.</p>

<p>As it turned out, he was well repaid for the
danger he had run in coming there, for he heard
the British soldiers talking of how they were
going to visit a settlement made up mostly of
patriots, as soon as it was dark, plunder the
homes of the settlers, and then burn the houses
down.</p>

<p>It was a cold-blooded plan, and Dick shuddered
as he listened, but at the same time he made
up his mind to hasten to the settlement, warn the
settlers, and thus enable them to either prepare
to defend themselves, or take their leave before
the redcoats put in an appearance.</p>

<p>Dick was on the point of slipping away, when
he saw a couple of redcoats leave the group and
come slowly toward the very tree behind which
he was standing.</p>

<p>His blood suddenly seemed to congeal, for he
realized that he was in great danger of discovery
and capture.</p>

<h1 id='t370'>CHAPTER II—Roughly Handled</h1>

<p>About the time that Dick was standing behind
the tree, with the two redcoats approaching,
in a little log cabin that was used as
a school building, at a point about a mile from a
Tory settlement consisting of about thirty families,
sat a rather good-looking young man of
perhaps twenty-four years of age. He was to
play a rather important part in the life of Dick
Dare and must now be introduced to the reader.</p>

<p>Herbert Miller was his name, and he was the
teacher of the school. As the children had gone
home, he was sitting at his desk, reading.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the schoolhouse stood about
a mile from a Tory settlement, and about two
miles from the schoolhouse, in the other direction,
was a patriot settlement, consisting of about
a dozen families. The schoolhouse had been
placed where it stood, for the convenience of the
children from both settlements, but was closer to
the Tory settlement because there were more of
the Tories than of the patriots. Of late, however,
since the coming into that region of Arnold,
with his army of British and Tory soldiers, the
Tories of the settlement had grown rather arrogant.
This, being taken up by their children, resulted
in lots of trouble at the school, the Tory
children abusing the patriot children in spite of
the efforts of the teacher to prevent it, and at
the time of which we write only a few patriot
children were attending the school. These few
were the larger children, who could hold their
own successfully against the arrogant and aggressive
Tory children.</p>

<p>Herbert Miller was an intelligent young man,
and he was at heart a sympathizer with the patriots,
and hoped the American people would gain
their independence, but of course he did not say
much about this in the settlement, where he
boarded. He was not a resident of this community,
having come from a point more than a
hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of voices and the scraping
of feet were heard by the teacher, and he rose
and walked to the door. He was about to open
it, but hesitated, and then placed his eye to a
crack and looked through. He saw standing in
front of the schoolhouse four men, and they
were the worst and most rabid Tories in the settlement.
Their leader was Hank Sprowl. He
was practically a desperado, who made his living
by hunting, and was not liked even by those who
professed to be his friends.</p>

<p>Miller stood there gazing through the crack
and wondering why the Tories were there. What
did it mean? And why did they not enter, if
they had business with him?</p>

<p>These questions he could not answer, and so
after hesitating a few moments, he having first
thought of opening the door and questioning the
men, he turned and walked back to his desk, sat
down and began reading. “If they have any
business with me, they will come in and say so,
presently.” This he thought was likely.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miller’s attention was attracted by
a tapping on the window, and he glanced in that
direction, and saw the face of Henry Philips,
a boy of ten years, and a true friend of his. The
boy was indeed a patriot at heart, and for that
reason he was not liked by the other pupils at
the school, and Miller had often interfered to
keep bigger boys from abusing Henry, thus
earning the boy’s regards.</p>

<p>There was a look of excitement on the boy’s
face, and Miller, guessing that there was something
in the wind, rose and went quietly to the
window, and raising it, was about to speak, but
the boy said, “Sh! Don’t say anything, Mr.
Miller. I’ve come to warn ye.”</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” the teacher asked in
a whisper.</p>

<p>“The Tories are goin’ to ketch ye when ye
leave the schoolhouse an’ give ye a coat uv tar
an’ feathers!” whispered the boy, glancing warily
around him.</p>

<p>Miller started. “Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Cause ye’re a patriot,” was the reply.
“Hank Sprowl an’ two or three more Tories are
aroun’ at the front, now, waitin’ fur ye to come
out.”</p>

<p>“I knew they were out there, Henry, but I
didn’t know, could not imagine, why they were
there. So that is what they are up to, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ ye had better climb out of the winder
an’ make your escape.”</p>

<p>Doubtless that was Miller’s first inclination,
but he thought a few moments, and then shook
his head. “I don’t think that I’ll do that,
Henry,” he said. “No, I’ll go out through the
front door, as usual, and I don’t believe they’ll
dare lay hands on me.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’ know Hank Sprowl ef ye think that,”
said the boy. “He’s a bad one, he is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that, but I’m not going to climb
out at the window and try to avoid them. I
might as well meet them face to face, and I don’t
believe they’ll bother me.”</p>

<p>“They’re cookin’ the tar down here in the
gully,” said the boy, his face pale. “An’ I seen
Jim Simmons comin’ with a bag of feathers as I
left the gully.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll not try to avoid them by slipping
out of the window, Henry. If they are
making their preparations, I might as well meet
them and show them that I’m not afraid of them.”</p>

<p>“They’ll handle ye rough, Mister Miller,” said
the boy, his face pale. “They’re mighty mean
men, them fellers that Hank Sprowl has helpin’
him.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Henry. I’m much obliged for
your kindness in coming to warn me. Now you
had better go, before they see you, and handle
you roughly also.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go. Well, good-by, Mister Miller. I
hope they won’t put no tar an’ feathers onto
ye.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think they will, Henry. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Then the boy dropped to the ground, and disappeared
into the brush at the back of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>Miller slowly and thoughtfully lowered the
window, returned, took a seat at his desk, and
sat there, gazing toward the door and evidently
doing a lot of thinking. He glanced toward the
window once or twice, and then resolutely rose
and walked to the door, and opening it, stepped
out of doors--to be confronted by Hank Sprowl
and the three Tories.</p>

<p>“Good evening, gentlemen,” greeted Miller,
pleasantly. “Fine evening, is it not?”</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances, and it was evident
that they were somewhat taken aback by the coolness
and <span class='it'>sang froid</span> of their intended victim.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’,” said Sprowl, gruffly. “Yas,
et’s a fine evenin’--a fine evenin’ to put geese-feathers
onto rebel birds like ye! Hey, fellers?”</p>

<p>The others nodded, and one said: “Ye’re
right, Hank.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Miller, pretending
that he did not grasp Sprowl’s meaning.</p>

<p>“I mean that we’re goin’ to give ye a coat of
tar and feathers, ye blamed rebel!” snarled
Sprowl. “That’s what I mean.”</p>

<p>Miller looked from one to another inquiringly,
and then said: “Why should you want to do
that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve jest told ye,” replied Sprowl, harshly.
“Because ye’re a rebel, that’s why.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a rebel.”</p>

<p>“I know better. Ye air a rebel. We’ve heerd
how ye talk in favor of the rebels, and how ye
hev said as how ye hope ther rebels will win in
ther war ag’in ther king. Ye kain’t deny that
ye hev talked in favor of ther rebels, an’ so now
we’re goin’ to give ye a coat of tar and feathers
an’ twenty-four hours to git out of this part of
the country. We don’t want no rebel a teachin’
our children rebel sentiments.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my friends,” said Miller, calmly,
“but I shall not quit teaching here unless told to do
so by the men that hired me--and neither of
you had anything to do with that. I will now
go on home. Good evening,” and he walked
quietly away.</p>

<p>This action on his part so amazed the ruffians
that they stood there, staring after him, with
mouths agape. But Hank Sprowl presently
recovered from his amazement, and said to his companions
sharply: “After him, boys! We
mustn’t let him git away. We’ll give him that
coat of tar and feathers, that’s what we’ll do.
Come with me.”</p>

<p>Then he hastened after Miller, and his three
companions hurried to followed him. They
soon caught up with the young man, and as he
heard their footsteps, and half-turned, as if to
speak to them, they leaped upon him and bore
him struggling to the ground.</p>

<p>Miller was a rather strong and athletic young
man, and he fought with all his strength. But
four to one was too big odds, and he was soon
overpowered. Then, with his hands tied together
behind his back, they hustled Miller to
a nearby gully, where a kettle was already suspended
above a fire, and in the kettle itself was
a lot of tar, bubbling at a great rate. Near at
hand was a bag of feathers.</p>

<p>“Ther tar’s cooked good enuff,” said Sprowl.
“Take it off and let it cool a little bit. We’ve
got ther bird here, an’ we’ll soon put ther
feathers onto him.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I protest against any such proceeding,”
said Miller, with dignity. “You have
no right to do any such thing as that. I demand
that you set me free and let me go my way.”</p>

<p>“Ye kin demand, but that’s all ther good et’ll
do ye,” grinned Sprowl.</p>

<p>A couple of the ruffians took the kettle off the
fire, and set it at one side to cool a few minutes.
Then one or two of the others took off Miller’s
coat, vest and shirt, and Sprowl ordered them
to get to work, which they did, one applying the
tar to the teacher’s body with a brush, while
others sprinkled on the feathers.</p>

<p>The tar was still too hot for comfort, and
Miller writhed and gave utterance to groans
expressive of pain, in spite of his efforts to keep
from doing so, but the ruffians merely laughed
and kept on till they had finished. Then they
gave Miller a shove, and told him to go.</p>

<p>“And see to it thet ye are gone from this
neighborhood in twenty-four hours!” cried
Sprowl. “Ef we ketch ye here, arter that,
we’ll give ye somethin’ worse’n tar and feathers.
Now git!”</p>

<p>And Miller, glad to escape from such heartless
villains, staggered away through the forest,
followed by jeering remarks and coarse laughter
from the Tories.</p>

<h1 id='t646'>CHAPTER III—Lizzie Santon</h1>

<p>Lizzie Santon, the daughter of John
Santon, a patriot who lived about halfway
between the Tory and the patriot settlements,
was out searching for their cow, that had wandered
away, and the girl, humming a song,
made her way through the timber, looking about
her keenly and searchingly.</p>

<p>It was now growing dusk, and the girl hastened
her footsteps, for she was a mile from home
and still had seen no signs of the sought for
animal.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw a form moving in the
woods at a distance of perhaps one hundred
yards, and she uttered an exclamation of satisfaction
and hastened in that direction.</p>

<p>But when she was within perhaps twenty
yards of the approaching object, she saw that
it was a human being, but with the upper portion
of the body covered with feathers.</p>

<p>“What can that mean?” the girl murmured,
stopping and staring in wonder, amazement and
horror. “Why, that is terrible! Who would
dare treat a human being in that barbarous
fashion?”</p>

<p>She stood there a few moments, and then
noticing that the tarred and feathered man was
walking in a zigzag fashion, as if unable to see,
she advanced till close to the person, and then
she said:</p>

<p>“Who are you? And who did this?”</p>

<p>It was the teacher, of course, and at the sound
of the voice he came to a stop and exclaimed,
joyously: “Thank goodness I have found
somebody. I am Herbert Miller, and some
Tories did this, because they believed me to be
a patriot.”</p>

<p>“What villains!” exclaimed the girl. “This
is terrible, Mr. Miller.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so it is. Is that you, Miss Santon?
It sounds like your voice.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why, can’t you see me?”</p>

<p>“No, they got a lot of the tar in my eyes, and
they have swollen shut. I have just been
wandering in the woods, feeling my way.
Would it be asking too much for you to conduct
me to the home of a patriot, where I can
get rid of the tar and feathers?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I shall be only too glad to help you,
Mr. Miller. I will guide you to my home, and
father will help you get rid of your coat of tar
and feathers and will give you some of his clothes
to put on. Give me your hand.”</p>

<p>She took hold of Miller’s hand, and they
made their way through the timber at a moderate
pace, the young man telling the story of the
affair in detail as they went.</p>

<p>The girl was profuse in her denunciations of
the ruffians who had perpetrated the outrage, and
said that they ought to be punished. But as the
majority of the people in that vicinity were
Tories, it was not likely that the ruffians would
be bothered.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Lizzie’s home, Mr.
Santon took Miller in hand, and after an hour
or so of hard work, got much of the tar and
feathers washed off. The young man had been
bathing his eyes at the same time, and had gotten
them so that he could open them part way and
could see, so he now donned shirt, and coat,
given him by the patriot settler, and felt much
better.</p>

<p>“I’ll be all right now,” he said. “Thanks to
you and Lizzie, Mr. Santon.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You’re welcome, Mr.
Miller. I’ve kind of expected something of this
kind, for I knew you were in sympathy with the
patriot Cause, and I have heard the Tories say
that they didn’t like the idea of having a rebel
to teach their children. You kind of took the
side of the patriot children, in their squabbles
with the Tory children at school, you know, and
the Tories didn’t like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true. Well, I suppose that
there would be no use for me to go back to the
settlement.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t risk it, if I were you. They
might take it into their heads to kill you, next
time.”</p>

<p>“I think that a good many of the Tories
would not approve of what Sprowl and his gang
did, but they are in the minority, and I suppose
the majority of the families will be glad they
did it, and likely, as you say, the ruffians would
do worse next time.”</p>

<p>“I think it likely.”</p>

<p>“I fear that I may get you into trouble, Mr.
Santon, by staying here at your home,” the young
man said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” slowly and thoughtfully.
“And likely they don’t know you are here.”</p>

<p>“That is probable. I wandered quite a ways
before I came up with your daughter. I don’t
suppose any of the ruffians followed.”</p>

<p>“No, likely not. You’re safe here, and I
don’t think they will bother me for having you
here.”</p>

<p>“I hope not. I think that perhaps it will be
well for me to go over to the patriot settlement,
to-morrow, however.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about it, Mr. Miller.”</p>

<p>Supper was ready, presently, and the teacher
ate at the table with the family, and repeated his
story for the benefit of the other members, there
being several children besides Lizzie. Mr. and
Mrs. Santon looked very sober and thoughtful,
for they lived only about a mile and a half from
the Tory settlement, and if the Tories got angry
at them, they might make it very disagreeable
for them.</p>

<p>After supper the teacher and the members of
the Santon family sat in the big sitting-room and
talked a while, and then the young man was
conducted to an upstairs room by Mr. Santon,
and he began making preparations to go to bed.</p>

<p>He had only begun, however, when he heard
footsteps on the gravel walk in the yard, and then
followed a loud knocking on the door. Following
this came in the loud, hoarse voice of Hank
Sprowl:</p>

<p>“Open ther door, John Santon, or we’ll kick
it down. We know thet ye’re harborin’ that
rebel skule-teacher that we tarred and feathered
this evenin’, and ye’ve got ter give him up. Ef
ye don’t, et’ll be the worse for ye. Open the
door!”</p>

<p>With the remembrance still fresh in his mind
of the treatment accorded him by the same gang
that was now likely at the door, Herbert Miller
may be excused for feeling somewhat horror-stricken
when he heard the demands given
utterance to by the leader of the Tory gang.</p>

<p>He remembered what Mr. Santon had said,
and wondered if they had come to kill him, this
time.</p>

<h1 id='t826'>CHAPTER IV—Warning the Settlers</h1>

<p>Slowly the two redcoats approached. Dick
looked around him, for some place where
he could conceal himself, but did not discover
any. He was on the point of turning-and taking
refuge in flight when the soldiers suddenly
stopped while yet perhaps ten or fifteen yards
from him, and stood talking earnestly.</p>

<p>This gave Dick an opportunity, and he at once
took advantage of it. He turned and behind the
shelter of a fallen log dropped to his hands and
knees. He began crawling away now as rapidly
as he could and at the same time not make any
noise that would be heard by the two redcoats.</p>

<p>Dick was an expert in woodcraft, and he felt
that he would be able to get away without being
seen, if the redcoats stood there conversing for
a sufficient length of time. With this hope in
his mind he kept on crawling, and when he was
perhaps fifty yards away, he rose cautiously to
his feet, keeping a tree between himself and his
enemies, and looked back to see what they were
doing.</p>

<p>The two were just entering the edge of the
forest, but were still engaged in conversation and
did not have eyes for anything about them, so
Dick fortunately was not in much danger of
being seen.</p>

<p>He hastened back to where he had left Tom
and Ben, and told them what he had heard.
They were eager and excited, and said they were
glad that Dick had succeeded in learning the
plans of the party of British whom they had
chanced upon.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” asked Tom.
“Shall one of us go back to our encampment
and bring a party of soldiers to attack the
British?”</p>

<p>“It would be impossible to get a party of our
soldiers here before midnight or even later,”
determined Dick. “It will be dark in a couple
of hours, and then the redcoats will likely go the
settlement to plunder and burn the houses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it must be twenty miles, at least, to our
encampment,” admitted Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Dick, “and so the only
thing for us to do is to go to the settlement as
quickly as possible, and warn the patriots.”</p>

<p>“That will be the best plan,” acquiesced Tom.
“Let’s start at once, boys.”</p>

<p>“All right. We may lose a little time looking
for the settlement, so we had better start
now.”</p>

<p>They set out, but made a detour and went
around the encampment of the British soldiers,
keeping at a distance, so as not to be seen. And
when on the other side of the camp, they walked
rapidly in the direction that they believed would
take them to the patriot settlement.</p>

<p>They searched around more than an hour, and
finally caught sight of the houses of the settlement,
through a clearing. With exclamations of
satisfaction, they hastened forward.</p>

<p>They were not long in reaching the settlement,
and going to about the largest house, one
of them knocked on the door. The door was
opened by a man of middle age, who eyed the
youths curiously.</p>

<p>“How are you, sir?” said Dick, while Tom
and Ben nodded a greeting. “Is this a patriot
settlement?”</p>

<p>The man started. “Why do you ask?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“Because, if such is the case, we have some
important information for you.”</p>

<p>“What is the information?” The man
looked eagerly at the youths.</p>

<p>“There is a party of British soldiers encamped
a couple of miles from here, sir,” said Dick.
“We spied on them and overheard them talking,
and it is their plan to come here soon after
dark, plunder your houses and then set fire to
them. We hastened here to tell you the news.”</p>

<p>“And you did well, young men. I thank you,
in the name of the people of the settlement.
Who are you, and where are you from?”</p>

<p>“My name is Dick Dare, and this is my
brother Tom, and this is a comrade, Ben Foster.
We have just come down into this part of the
country, from New York, with a regiment of
patriot soldiers under General Morris. Our
camp is about twenty miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I am indeed glad to hear that there is
a patriot force in this part of the country,” said
the man. “Since Arnold came here and took
command of the British force in Virginia, we
have been having a hard time of it. He seems
to be extremely bitter, the soldiers and Tories
are rough and insolent, and there has been a great
deal of plundering and burning of houses recently.”</p>

<p>“Well, seemingly that is what the redcoats
we saw intend doing here, to-night.”</p>

<p>“I will call the men of the settlement together,
and we will decide what to do,” announced the
man. “I will have them come here to my
house, and you young men may as well remain
here. Just step inside and have seats.”</p>

<p>“We will sit here on the steps,” said Dick.
“It is pleasant out of doors.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” and the man hastened away.</p>

<p>The youths sat down and waited, and in ten or
fifteen minutes there were a dozen men gathered
there in front of the house. After greeting the
youths, they discussed the matter at issue, and
finally decided that the only feasible course was
to take some essential household goods and go
to a swamp a mile and a half distant. There
was a small island in the middle of the swamp,
they said, that would furnish them an abiding-place
for a while, until the redcoats went away,
and as the path leading to the island in the
swamp was a narrow and crooked one, they did
not think the redcoats could follow it. At any
rate they could not do so in the dark.</p>

<p>As soon as this decision had been settled upon,
the women were notified, and at once all began
work. Even the children helped, and soon all
the household goods of much value that could
be carried had been brought out, and were gotten
into shape for carrying.</p>

<p>Dick, Tom and Ben, of course, had helped,
and at Dick’s suggestion some of the children
had been stationed out in the forest two or
three hundred yards, to keep watch and give
warning in case the redcoats should be heard
approaching.</p>

<p>The settlers had just finished the work of getting
the household goods out of the houses, when
the young sentinels came running up and said
that they had heard voices, and had seen forms
moving amid the trees.</p>

<p>“The redcoats are coming!” said Dick.
“You must get away from here quickly. There
is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Mr. Williams, the first
man the youths had spoken to at the settlement.</p>

<p>“Gather up the goods and we will start for the
swamp.”</p>

<p>This was done, and men, women and children,
loaded down with the household effects, staggered
through the woods, following the lead of Mr.
Williams.</p>

<p>They had gone perhaps a third of a mile
when they heard yells from the direction of the
settlement, and knew that the redcoats had
reached there and found their intended victims
missing.</p>

<p>“They will likely follow,” said Dick. “We
had better hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will go as fast as possible,” said
Mr. Williams. “It is scarcely a mile to the
swamp.”</p>

<p>They hastened onward, and although they
listened intently, trying to learn whether they
were being followed, they did not hear any sound
to indicate that such was the case.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a stop, Mr. Williams
having called to them to do so, as the edge of
the swamp had been reached. He had brought
a torch along, and now at the shut of dark this
he lighted. Taking the lead, he guided the party
into the swamp, keeping on the narrow, winding
path. Without the light it would have been
impossible to follow the trail, and to have gotten
off into the quagmire at the sides would have
been to perhaps lose their lives, for it seemed to
have no bottom, the settlers said, being like
quicksand.</p>

<p>They had gone about a quarter of a mile,
when they heard yells behind them. They
realized that the redcoats had followed, and
having seen the light, knew where the fugitives
were.</p>

<p>“They will light a torch and try to follow
us, likely,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Mr. Williams. “Well, if
they do, we will have to fight them off, for the
path, where it connects with the island is very
tortuous and narrow. At places not more than
two feet wide, and so only a few of them could
get at us at a time.”</p>

<p>Presently the fugitives reached the island, and
they carried the household goods over to the
farther side, where they were placed on the
ground, while they sat down to rest. They had
hurried and the women and children were tired
indeed.</p>

<p>They had been sitting there only a few
minutes, however, when suddenly Dick exclaimed
“Look yonder! I see a light. The redcoats are coming!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, a light that flickered and bobbed
this way and that, in among the trees, could be
seen, and it was evident that the redcoats were
following the path leading to the island.</p>

<h1 id='t1076'>CHAPTER V—The Redcoats Foiled</h1>

<p>“I wonder how large a body of redcoats
there is, Dick?” Mr. Williams enquired
after a few moments.</p>

<p>“There are about twenty of them, sir,” replied
Dick promptly.</p>

<p>“And there are fifteen of us, counting you
three young men. I guess we will be able to
stand them off.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes. We will leave the women and children
in this sheltered spot. We will go over to near
the point where the path connects with the island,
and will await the coming of the enemy.”</p>

<p>This was done, and the settlers, rifles in hands,
and Dick, Tom and Ben, who had each two
pistols, were soon stationed at a vantage point
near the end of the path.</p>

<p>Here they crouched, watching the light as it
slowly approached, and presently they could make
out the forms of the redcoats. They were strung
out almost in single file, and were making their
way very slowly, for the ground was new to
them. But doubtless they had seen swamps
before, and knew that it would be bad for them
if they were to get off the path and into the
quagmire on either side.</p>

<p>Closer and closer they came, and when they
were within perhaps twenty yards of the point
where the path joined the island, Mr. Williams
called out loudly:</p>

<p>“Halt! Stop where you are!”</p>

<p>The man in the lead, carrying the torch,
stopped instantly and the other redcoats followed
suit. There was a brief period of silence, and
then the man with the torch cried:</p>

<p>“So you’re there, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re here,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re coming there to have a talk
with you, and--”</p>

<p>“You will advance another step at your
peril!” interrupted Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“Eh?” in an amazed voice. “You don’t
mean that you will show fight!”</p>

<p>“We certainly will show fight,” was the reply.
“The best thing that you can do is to turn around
and go back to the mainland.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we won’t do that.”</p>

<p>“You will be sorry if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Bosh. What can a little party of you farmers
do against a force of the king’s soldiers?”</p>

<p>“We are almost as many as your force, we
are all armed, and we know how to shoot.”</p>

<p>“Humph. How many are there of you?”</p>

<p>“There are fifteen of us.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are fifty in our party, so what
show do you stand of fighting against us successfully.”</p>

<p>“I have information to the effect that there
are only twenty in your party.”</p>

<p>This seemed to surprise the redcoats, and there
was silence for a few moments, and then the
leader said: “Who informed you to that effect,
if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“That is my affair.”</p>

<p>“Well, your informant was mistaken. There
are fifty of us, and if you try to show fight, we
will kill the whole gang of you.”</p>

<p>“You are only twenty, and we will fight you,
and will easily drive you away, too, for the
reason that the path is so narrow only a few of
you can approach at a time. We can shoot you
down as fast as you appear at the edge of the
island.”</p>

<p>Again there was a brief period of silence, and
then the leader walked back a few paces and
held a low conversation with a number of the
soldiers. Then he turned and advanced to within
about twenty-five yards of the edge of the
island, and called out sternly:</p>

<p>“Will you surrender?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You had better.”</p>

<p>“No, you had better go back to the mainland
and let us alone.”</p>

<p>“We are coming onto the island, and if you
fire upon us, it will go hard with you.”</p>

<p>“We will certainly fire,” was the determined
reply.</p>

<p>“Very well. Your blood be upon your own
heads, then.”</p>

<p>Then the leader called to the soldiers, saying:
“Follow me, men. And be ready to fire the
instant I give the word.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he thought that this command would
have the effect of frightening the patriot settlers
into not firing, but if so, he was mistaken, for
when the first of the party of soldiers was almost
to the island, Mr. Williams cried sternly:</p>

<p>“Halt and turn back. If you don’t do so at
once, we will fire.”</p>

<p>The soldiers continued to advance, and seeing
they did not intend to stop, the patriot settler
gave the command:</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>Instantly the sound of a volley from the dozen
rifles and the three pistols sounded on the night
air, and it was evident that two or three of the
British were at least wounded, for cries of pain
and rage went up. One was seen to have fallen,
and another was being held up by a couple of
his comrades.</p>

<p>“Fire at the rebels, men!” roared the leader
of the redcoats, and the British soldiers fired a
volley, the bullets rattling above the patriots’
heads, but not doing any damage, as the members
of the party had dropped flat on the ground.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Williams called out: “You can’t
hurt us, no matter how much you shoot, and we
can pick you off quickly. If you will return to
the mainland and go about your business, we
will not fire upon you again, but if you refuse
to go, we will open fire on you, and will kill and
wound a number of you.”</p>

<p>Evidently the leader of the party of redcoats
realized that, owing to the narrowness of the
path, and their inability to rush forward in a
body, they could not get at the settlers to do
them damage, and that it would be the part of
wisdom to do as the settler said, for he called
out:</p>

<p>“All right, we will return to the mainland.
Don’t fire.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>Then the British soldiers slowly made their
way back along the path, carrying one of their
comrades, and one or two assisting another.
When they were out of rifle-shot distance, the
leader of the party paused and yelled loudly:</p>

<p>“We will set up a siege at the point where the
path reaches the mainland, and you will not be
able to come off the island, and as soon as your
provisions are exhausted, you will have to surrender.”</p>

<p>Then the redcoats continued their progress toward
the mainland.</p>

<p>“If they set up a siege, it will be bad for us,”
said Mr. Williams, soberly. “We have only
enough food to last say two or three days.”
Then they stationed a couple of their number
at the end of the path, to give warning in case
the redcoats should return during the night, and
the others went back and rejoined the women
and children and their situation was discussed
with considerable seriousness.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the situation,” said Mr. Williams,
and the others said the same.</p>

<h1 id='t1284'>CHAPTER VI—Dick’s Daring Plan</h1>

<p>Presently the settlers lay down and as
a result of their weariness, they were soon
asleep. They felt safe, as there were men on
guard at the point where the path reached the
island, and knew the British could not reach the
island without being seen.</p>

<p>Next morning the subject of what should be
done was taken up, and the men discussed the
matter thoroughly, but could not come to any decision.
Dick Dare and his two comrades had not
had much to say, as they considered themselves
outsiders, but when the settlers had talked an
hour or so and had not come to any decision,
Dick, who had been doing considerable thinking,
rose and walked along the shore of the island,
peering up into the trees that extended away
across the swamp. Then he came back, and said
to Mr. Williams: “How far is it to the mainland,
in that direction,” pointing toward the
north. The path by which they had come connected
with the island on the east side.</p>

<p>“About a mile, I should judge,” replied Mr.
Williams. “Why?”</p>

<p>“I have a plan which I think may work,” was
the reply. “I notice that the trees in the swamp
are rather close together, and the limbs intermingle.
I believe that I can reach the shore by
climbing from one treetop to another. What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“It might be possible to do that,” was the reply.
“An active young fellow like you might
do it. If you should happen to fall into the bog,
however, it would likely be the last that would
ever be heard of you, as it is like quicksand, and
sucks its victims down out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I will try it, anyhow. If I
can reach the mainland, I can go to the encampment
of our army and get some of the soldiers
to come and drive the redcoats away, or, better
still, capture them.”</p>

<p>“That would be splendid, if you could accomplish
it,” said the settler.</p>

<p>“I think it worth trying,” said Dick, confidently.
“I am a good climber, and believe that
I can make my way from one tree to another,
and thus reach the shore.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that I could, too,” said Tom, eagerly.
“You stay here and let me go, Dick.”</p>

<p>But Dick shook his head. “I am older and
stronger than you, Tom,” he said, “and as it
will be a hard job working one’s way to the
mainland, I prefer to make the attempt. You
and Ben will stay here.”</p>

<p>“All right, just as you say.”</p>

<p>“I’ll start immediately,” determined Dick.</p>

<p>“You had better take some food with you,”
suggested Mr. Williams. “You will find your
task a hard one and you may have to go two or
three miles in order to reach the shore, for you
will have to work your way wherever the trees
are thickest.”</p>

<p>“True, sir,” said Dick.</p>

<p>He tied up a package of food, and fastened it
on his shoulder by a piece of leather string, and
then, after talking to Tom and Ben a few moments,
he said good-by to all the folks. Stepping
to a tree that grew right at the edge of the
island, climbed it, till high enough up so that the
limbs were of good size and extending to those
of another tree out in the swamp, and then he
worked his way across into the other tree.</p>

<p>“Good for you,” congratulated Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it, Dick,” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“It is going to be slow work,” replied Dick.
“But I think I can reach the mainland by noon,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Then Dick managed to get across to another
tree still farther away from the island, and here
he paused a few moments, to get his breath.</p>

<p>He talked to the settlers on the island while
resting, then again began work, and by a strenuous
effort succeeded in getting to another tree.
From this one he reached another. Here he
paused and rested again a few moments, after
which he started again, and got into another tree,
but one that was no farther from the island, but
from that one he could reach another tree that
was farther away.</p>

<p>“It’s work that takes muscle,” said Dick, stopping
to breathe a few moments. “But thank
goodness I have plenty of muscle.”</p>

<p>Then he began work again, and was soon
in a tree that stood nearly fifty yards from the
island.</p>

<p>Here he paused a few moments, and then set
out again. When an hour had passed, he was at
least a hundred yards from the island.</p>

<p>“Pretty tired?” called Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“Oh, not so very,” was the reply. “I’ll get
to the mainland, all right.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope so,” was the reply.</p>

<p>On went Dick, picking his way along the tree
branches, and he gradually worked his way well
out into the swamp. Presently he could not see
the people on the island at all. And they, not
being able to see him, and fearing that their
voices might carry to the redcoats on the east
shore, if they yelled too loudly, stopped calling
to the youth who was working so hard to get to
the mainland, in order to go and get the patriot
soldiers and effect their rescue.</p>

<p>The work Dick was engaged in was strenuous
to say the least. It was very trying to his muscles,
but he was strong and had good staying
qualities, and he kept at it, pausing once in a
while to breathe a few moments and rest his
tired muscles.</p>

<p>Slowly he worked his way out, through the
tops of the trees, his life in danger, for if he
were to slip and fall, he would sink deep into
the quagmire, likely, and the chances were that
he would be pulled down by the quicksand and
smothered to death in the bog.</p>

<p>Dick did not stop to think of this, however.
His mind was on his work, and he kept on, gradually
shortening the distance to the mainland.</p>

<p>When he had been thus employed perhaps
three hours, however, he came to a point from
which it seemed impossible to reach another treetop.
He paused and stood on a limb and gazed
about him, keenly and searchingly. Should he
go back and try some other direction?</p>

<p>Finally he decided that by climbing out on a
limb that extended upward and outward from
the tree he was in, and bending the end down,
he might succeed in springing across from that
limb to one on the nearest tree.</p>

<p>He at once put this into effect, and climbing
up the limb in question till he was near the end,
he threw his weight in such a manner that the
limb was bent down almost to the breaking point.
Still he found himself to be fully three feet from
the limb on the other next nearest tree.</p>

<p>Now just by the force from his arms, must he
throw his body across that distance, and more,
for he must needs grasp the other limb at a point
where it was sizable enough to bear his weight.
He would make the attempt, anyway, for if he
could get across this open space, the trees were
close together beyond, and he would not have
much difficulty in continuing the trip to the mainland.</p>

<p>So he began swaying his body back and forth,
like a pendulum, till he got it swinging at a lively
rate, and then he suddenly hurled himself
through the air, letting go of the limb at the
same moment, and making an effort to grasp the
limb on the other tree.</p>

<p>He did get hold of the limb, but at a point
too near the end, and the limb, being too small,
slipped through his fingers and down he shot,
striking the quagmire with a thud, and sinking to
his knees.</p>

<p>An exclamation of dismay escaped Dick’s lips.
He looked around him, for something to get hold
of to stay his sinking into the bog, but there was
nothing within reach that he could catch hold
of. Not even a clump of bushes was near. He
was in an open space perhaps thirty feet square,
and there was no tree closer than twenty feet.</p>

<p>Dick then began trying to pull his legs out of
the bog, but found he could not do so. The
harder he worked, the faster he seemed to sink
into the quagmire, and after a few moments of
strenuous effort, in which he failed to loosen
either limb, but in fact found each leg deeper in
the bog, he desisted. His face perspiring profusely,
he stood there panting for breath as a
result of his strenuous exertions, and gazed about
him, hoping to see some means by which he might
extricate himself from the dangerous predicament
in which he had fallen.</p>

<p>But there was nothing that seemed to offer
any promise of assistance, and he began struggling
again, only to desist after a few moments,
realizing how foolish was the attempt, for every
effort he put forth only served to sink him deeper
in the boggy quicksand.</p>

<p>Down he sank, slowly and gradually, till he
was up to his waist in the relentless and encompassing
sands. Then, realizing that he was unable
to extricate himself, Dick, because of his
utterly helpless situation, gave vent to a despairing
cry and called loudly for help.</p>

<p>Again and again he called, but there came no
response. All remained quiet around him.
There was no sign or likelihood of assistance
from any source. And by now he had sunk till
he was halfway from his waist to his armpits.
He was held as if by giant hands, and he realized
that he could not escape without assistance--and
help was certainly not forthcoming.</p>

<p class='caption'>He was held as if by giant hands.</p>
</div>

<p>Dick Dare had been in lots of tight places in
his life, but never had he been in the danger that
threatened him now. He felt that he was
doomed, that he would go to a terrible, horrible
death, there beneath the smothering slime of the
boggy quicksand. He thought of the loved ones
at home, of his brother, his comrades, and the
great Cause for which he was to offer up his
young life. Now he was to be blotted out and
no one would ever know the awful nature of his
death.</p>

<h1 id='t1544'>CHAPTER VII—In the Tories’ Hands Again</h1>

<p>Herbert Miller, the young schoolteacher,
when he heard the demand made
by Hank Sprowl, felt that he was in great danger.
He realized that the Tories were bad men,
and that they might kill him, if they got hold of
him again. And as he had a young man’s desire
to live, he made up his mind not to let them
get hold of him, if possible to avoid the contingency.</p>

<p>The room Miller was in was at the front of
the house, and that was the reason he heard the
words of the Tory. It was a starlight night,
and stepping to the window, the teacher looked
out and downward. He saw several dark forms
standing before the house. There were six or
seven of the scoundrels, Miller decided, and that
would be too many for him to try to fight against,
even with the assistance of Mr. Santon. Furthermore,
as the young man had no wish to get his
friends into trouble, he made up his mind that
the best thing he could do would be to make his
escape.</p>

<p>With this idea in mind, he left the front room,
and made his way into a chamber at the rear.
Opening the window, he looked out and about.
There was no one in sight, so the young man decided
that he would be able to leap to the ground
and get safely away.</p>

<p>Climbing cautiously over the ledge, he seized
hold of the window-sill and lowered himself till
he hung suspended at full length. Then he relaxed
his hold and dropped. He alighted on his
feet all right and unhurt, and turned to leave--when
around the corner rushed four of the
Tories.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” yelled one. “Grab ’im, men.”</p>

<p>They dashed forward and seized Miller before
he could make his escape, and although he fought
desperately, he was overpowered. The rest of
the gang came rushing around the corner, just
as the four had gotten the better of the teacher,
and his arms were quickly tied together behind
his back.</p>

<p>They conducted him around to the front of
the house, and Sprowl calling Mr. Santon to the
door gave him a rough talking to. “If ever we
ketch ye harborin’ or helpin’ another rebel, John
Santon, we’ll drive ye out uv ther country. D’ye
hear?” he said in conclusion.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear,” was the reply. There was an
angry look on Mr. Santon’s face, but he did not
say much, for he realized that it would not take
many words from him to cause the ruffians to
seize him and give him a rough handling, the
same as they likely intended doing with Miller.
He did ask, however, what they proposed doing
with the teacher.</p>

<p>“Oh, thet’s our bizness,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ to try to do enuff, this time, to
discourage him frum tryin’ to stay aroun’ in this
part of the country, though. Ye may be sure uv
thet.”</p>

<p>Then they set out through the woods, Miller in
their midst. “Don’t worry about me, Mr. Santon,”
the teacher called back over his shoulder.
“They won’t dare do me serious injury.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t we, hey?” growled Sprowl.
“Wai, mebby ye’ll change yer mind afore we git
through with ye.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, I’m afraid they’ll kill him!”
half-moaned Lizzie, when the group had disappeared
amid the trees.</p>

<p>“I don’t hardly think they will dare do that,
Lizzie,” was the sober reply. “But I fear they
will give him rough treatment.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we prevent it somehow, father?”
There was great eagerness in the voice of the
girl. It was evident that she was deeply moved.
The fact was, that she thought a great deal of
Herbert Miller. And he, on his part, thought a
great deal of Lizzie Santon.</p>

<p>Mr. Santon shook his head. “I’m afraid we
can’t, Lizzie,” he said. “There are seven of
them.”</p>

<p>“But, we can take our rifles, and follow them,
father, and if they go to injure Mr. Miller, we
can shoot some of them. I can shoot as good
as any man, you know, father.”</p>

<p>Mr. Santon hesitated a few moments, and then
said: “Very well, Lizzie. We’ll follow them,
and perhaps we may be able to drive them away,
if they try to injure Mr. Miller. Let’s hurry, or
they’ll get so far away we won’t be able to follow
them.”</p>

<p>He seized his rifle, and the girl did the same.
With a few words to Mrs. Santon, they left the
house, and set out through the timber. But they
had gone only about fifty yards, when a rough
voice challenged them.</p>

<p>“Stop whar ye are!” called the voice, threateningly.
“Ef ye come any furder, we’ll plug
ye. Hank said as how mebby ye’d try to foller
us, an’ made us stay behin’ to watch fur ye.
Now, ef ye value yer lives, ye’ll turn aroun’ an’
go right back ter the house, an’ stay thar. Ye
hear?”</p>

<p>“We may as well go back, Lizzie,” said her
father. “They’ll shoot us if we try to follow
now.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s what we will, Santon. Ye’re talkin’
sense. Git back to ther house, now, an’ stay
thar. Ef ye come out ag’in, we’ll shoot furst an’
mebby talk arterwards.”</p>

<p>“Come, Lizzie,” said Mr. Santon, sadly, and
they turned and went back to the house.</p>

<p>“Sprowl left a couple of his men to watch and
prevent us from following,” explained Mr. Santon
to his wife, and Lizzie, with tears of disappointment
in her eyes, went up to her room.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sprowl and four of his companions--he had,
as we know, left two men
behind to watch Santon’s house--made their
way onward till they had gone about two miles,
and then they came to a log cabin in a hollow.
There was a thick growth of trees and many
clumps of bushes all around, which would make
it difficult for a chance passerby to see the cabin,
even though his path led within a short distance
of it.</p>

<p>Here the ruffians stopped, and Sprowl ordered
that Miller be stripped to the waist.</p>

<p>“We giv’ ye a coat uv tar an’ feathers, ther
other time,” he said, “but this time we’re goin’
to give ye ther blamedest lickin’ ye ever got in
your life. Tie ’im to that tree, boys.” The last
words to his men, who had already quickly divested
the teacher of his clothing, and he stood
there, naked to the waist.</p>

<p>“You will be sorry for this, Hank Sprowl!”
said Miller. “You had better not commit this
outrage.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” was the brief reply. “Ye’re goin’
ter git a lickin’ ye’ll remember to yer dyin’ day,
an’ then ye’ hev twenty-four hours to leave ther
country in. Get the switches, men, an’ begin.”</p>

<p>A bundle of switches was produced from the
nearby cabin, and a couple of the ruffians took
each a heavy switch, several feet in length. Stationing
themselves on either side of their intended
victim, they lifted the switches and held them
poised, waiting for the word from Sprowl to
strike.</p>

<p>“Ready?” said Sprowl. “Go ahead. Give
’im a lickin’ thet’ll last ’im a lifetime.”</p>

<p>Herbert Miller set his teeth and waited.</p>

<h1 id='t1732'>CHAPTER VIII—Tim And Fritz At Work</h1>

<p>Soon after Dick, Tom and Ben left the patriot
encampment, to go in search of the
British army under General Arnold, Tim and
Fritz got to discussing the matter, and they decided
that they could do some good work in that
line also.</p>

<p>“Vy can’t ve go und make un efford to find
der retgoads, Tim?” was Fritz’s query.</p>

<p>“Sure an’ there’s no reason why we can’t,
Dootchy,” said Tim. “An’ it’s mesilf has a
good moind to go an’ ask the captain to let us
go an’ look fur the ridcoats.”</p>

<p>“Yah, go und ask him, Tim,” urged Fritz,
eagerly. “I vould lige to go on such a trip as
dot, und verily dot is so.”</p>

<p>So Tim, thus backed up, asked Captain
Morgan to let him and Fritz go in search of the encampment
of the redcoats.</p>

<p>“Why, the Dare boys and Ben Foster have
just gone to do that,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Yis, but there is no tellin’ what direction to
go to foind the ridcoats, captain,” said Tim,
“an’ we can go a different directions an’ mebby
will foind the encampment av the inimy before
the other byes do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you may go, then,” laughed the
captain, “but be careful, and don’t get captured
yourself.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful, captain, sure an’ we will.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Tim thanked the captain, hastened back and reported
his success to Fritz, who was delighted.
They made prompt preparations, and a few minutes
later they set out.</p>

<p>They started in a different direction from that
taken by the boys, but Tim and Fritz were not
very good at woodcraft, and gradually their
course was changed, till finally unwittingly they
were following almost in the steps of the three
youths. They supposed, agreeable to their proposal,
that they were going in an entirely different
direction.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Tim and Fritz came to
the top of the ridge, from which the three youths
had seen the camp of the party of redcoats, and
reaching there about an hour after the youths
had left. They stopped to rest, and soon caught
sight of the redcoats, in the same manner as the
youths had done.</p>

<p>They were greatly excited at once. “Sure an’
we’ve found thim alriddy!” exclaimed Tim.</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is so,” agreed Fritz. “But dere
are not many dere, Tim. Dis is not der big encampment.”</p>

<p>“Ye are roight, Fritz. This is a small party
thot is out on a foraging expedition, loikely.”</p>

<p>“Ve must sby on dem, Tim, und find ouid vot
dey are doin’ here,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Roight ye are, me bye. An’ it’s Tim Murphy
can do thot worruk, sure an’ it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah righd. You go und do dot vork, Tim.
I vill sday here und be ready to gome to your
assistance if you ged into drubble, already.”</p>

<p>“Thot’s all roight. Here Oi go, Fritz.”</p>

<p>Then Tim moved slowly and cautiously forward,
heading for the encampment of the redcoats.</p>

<p>He was not so skillful at this kind of work as
was Dick Dare, but he did pretty well in this instance,
and by going very slowly, he managed to
get over the ground without making much noise.</p>

<p>Closer and closer crept Tim, and finally he
came to a stop behind a tree about fifty yards
from the encampment. He could hear what the
redcoats said, but they were talking about matters
of no particular interest, and Tim did not
learn of their intention of plundering and burning
the patriot settlement.</p>

<p>Tim saw that there was only a small party of
the redcoats, and realizing that this was only a
detachment from Arnold’s army, he decided to
return to where he had left Fritz, and they would
go on their way and try to find the main encampment.</p>

<p>So he turned and slipped back in the direction
from which he had come, and when he neared
the top of the ridge and looked for his comrade,
he greatly to his surprise did not see him. Tim
supposed Fritz was seated behind a tree, however,
and thought nothing of it, but when he
reached the point where he had left the Dutch
youth, sure as fate Fritz was not there.</p>

<p>Tim looked all around, in surprise. Nowhere
could he see Fritz. Glancing toward the redcoat
camp, and deciding that they would not hear
him, he sounded a signal that they often used to
notify one of the other’s whereabouts.</p>

<p>Then he listened, but did not hear any reply.
Again he gave the signal, with the same result.</p>

<p>“Where has Dootchy gone, Oi wondther,”
muttered Tim, scratching his head. “Sure, an’
he’s so big thot av he was innywheres aroun’
here Oi ought to be able to see him.”</p>

<p>He looked in all directions, carefully, searchingly,
but Fritz was not to be seen, which was
very puzzling, and Tim did not understand it at
all.</p>

<p>“Thot does bate all,” murmured Tim. “What
shall Oi do? Shall Oi stay here, or go in search
av him?”</p>

<p>This was a problem, and Tim sat down, the
better to figure it out.</p>

<p>He was sitting there, his back against a tree,
trying to determine where Fritz could be, when
suddenly there was a rustling and scratching
sound above him, and then something hit him
on the head and shoulders, knocking him to the
ground and almost stunning him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Tim scrambled up hastily, and
was greatly amazed to see his comrade, Fritz,
lying on his back on the ground a few yards distant,
blinking up at the sky as if dazed. An exclamation
of anger and amazement escaped the
Irish soldier’s lips.</p>

<p>“Fritz, ye Dutch rascal, ye, where did ye
drop from, innyhow?” he cried.</p>

<p>Fritz blinked a few more times, and then slowly
rose to a sitting posture, looked at Tim, grinned
somewhat sheepishly, and then said: “From
der dreetop, Tim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye fell out av the tree, did ye?” the
Irish soldier remarked.</p>

<p>“Yah,” nodded the Dutchman. “I vos
glimbin’ down, alretty, an’ my hold slipped und
down I fell kerthump.”</p>

<p>“I should say ye did. Ye fell kerthump on
top av me head, sure an’ ye did. Why didn’t
ye tell me ye was comin’?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think uf dot, Tim,” was the reply.
“Und I’m sorriness dot I bumped you.”</p>

<p>“What was ye doin’ up in the tree?”</p>

<p>“I vos loogin’ around. I thought dot I mighd
see der big camp uf der retgoads.”</p>

<p>“Well, did ye?”</p>

<p>Fritz shook his head. “No, I saw only der
trees und timber,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do now? Go an’ look
for the big camp of the ridcoats?”</p>

<p>“Vot do you say to stayin’ und keepin’ watch
on dese retgoads till after dark, Tim?” said
Fritz. “Maybe dey vill go to der big engampment,
und den ve gan follow dem.”</p>

<p>“Sure an’ thot’s a good oidea, Fritz. We’ll
do thot.”</p>

<h1 id='t1931'>CHAPTER IX—Tim and Fritz</h1>

<p>Tim and Fritz settled down and made themselves as
comfortable as possible, and waited patiently for the coming
of darkness. They trusted that the redcoats would make some
kind of move by that time, and they hoped and believed that
the move would be in the direction of the main encampment of
the British.</p>

<p>The two had brought some food with him, and when evening
came, they ate a bite, after which they took turns going
down and getting a drink at a little creek at the foot of
the ridge.</p>

<p>As soon as dusk overspread the scene, they stole
down closer to the encampment, and took up their station
behind trees within fifty yards of the redcoats. They could
hear the spoken words of the soldiers now, and heard them
talking of
going to a patriot settlement, of plundering it and
burning the houses.</p>

<p>“So thot’s what they are afther doin’, eh?”
muttered Tim. “Well, it’s mean spalpanes they
are, an’ thot’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” replied Fritz, cautiously. “Dot vos
been a pretty mean vork vot dey are planning to
do, alretty.”</p>

<p>“Let’s slip aroun’ an’ thry to get to the settlement
an’ warn the patriots, Fritz,” whispered
Tim.</p>

<p>“All righd, ve vill do dot.”</p>

<p>They were just about to start, when the redcoats
suddenly broke camp--all they had to do
was to pick up their muskets and start--and
set out through the woods. Naturally exclamations
of disappointment and dismay escaped the
lips of the two.</p>

<p>“Dey’re goin’ to der settlement now!” exclaimed
Fritz.</p>

<p>“Yis. Well, let’s follow thim. Mebby we
can do somethin’ to hilp the patriots.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, Tim. Ve vill see abouid dot, anyhow.”</p>

<p>So they followed the party of redcoats, keeping
about two hundred yards behind them, and
after a walk of about a mile and a half, they
paused at the edge of a clearing of perhaps a
hundred acres, and at the farther side could be
seen the houses of the settlers.</p>

<p>What struck Tim and Fritz as queer was the
fact that they could not see any lights in any of
the houses, and this fact may have been noticed
by the redcoats, for they hastened forward at a
swifter pace.</p>

<p>“Looks loike there ain’t any people at home,
Dootchy,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Dot is der vay id loogs to me, Tim,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Oi hope thot is the case.”</p>

<p>“Yah, so do I.”</p>

<p>Feeling that they would be safe in doing so,
Tim and Fritz followed the redcoats, though
staying farther behind than when they were in
the timber, for even in the dusk they were more
likely to be seen out here in the open. The redcoats
had their attention centered on the cluster
of houses, however, and were not likely to look
behind them, so the two felt that they probably
would not be seen.</p>

<p>They were not more than a hundred yards behind
the redcoats when the latter reached the
houses. Tim and Fritz stopped and now lay
down on the ground, and watched and listened.</p>

<p>They saw lights appear in the houses presently,
and heard the voices of the redcoats raised in
tones of seeming anger. Tim chuckled and
said:</p>

<p>“They seem to be disappointed, Dootchy, me
bye.”</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is der vay id seems, Tim,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Looks loike the settlers found out thot the
ridcoats was comin’ an’ slipped away, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yah, dot seems to be der vay uf id.”</p>

<p>“Let’s move up closer, Dootchy.”</p>

<p>“Allrighd.”</p>

<p>They rose to their feet and approached the
cluster of houses, and on reaching the nearest
one, they peered in at the window. There were
two or three redcoats in the room, in which there
was little furniture or household goods of any
description, and the British soldiers were talking
and gesticulating angrily.</p>

<p>“Der settlers moved ouid und took der important
goods mit dem,” whispered Fritz.</p>

<p>“So it would seem, Fritz,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Then they went to the next house and looked
in, and the scene there was practically the same
as at the other house. After looking through
the window a few moments, the two went to the
next house, and found the same situation there.</p>

<p>“The settlers all got away before the ridcoats
got here, an’ they took their valuable goods wid
thim,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Yah, und der retgoads are pretty mad, alretty,”
replied Fritz.</p>

<p>“Thot’s what they are, an’ av they lay oyes on
us, it’ll go hard wid us, Fritz, me bye.”</p>

<p>“Dot is so. But ve must not let dem see us.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment some redcoats emerged
from the house beyond where the two soldiers
stood, and they were talking excitedly.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone into the swamp, that’s certain,”
the two heard one of the redcoats say. “And
we’ll follow them. We’ll have that plunder, in
spite of the trick they have played. We’ll follow
them into the swamp.”</p>

<p>Tim and Fritz dropped to the ground, close
beside the building, and remained there till the
redcoats had come forth from the houses and
had all set out in a direction which the two supposed
led to the swamp, and then they rose and
followed.</p>

<p>“We’ll kape afther thim, me bye,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Yah, ve vill do dot, Tim, und maybe ve gan
do somedings to help der settlers, alretty.”</p>

<p>They followed the redcoats to the edge of the
swamp, and remained concealed till the British
soldiers lighted a torch and set out along the
tortuous path into the swamp. Then they sat
down, to wait and discuss the situation.</p>

<p>“There’s goin’ to be a foight over in the
swamp, Dootchy, an’ we won’t be in it,” said
Tim, regretfully.</p>

<p>“Yah,” agreed Fritz. “I vould lige to take
a hand in dot fighd, but ve gouldn’t keep on der
path in der dark, alretty.”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll have to stay here an’ wait till the
ridcoats come back, Oi guiss,” said Tim.</p>

<h1 id='t2110'>CHAPTER X—To the Rescue</h1>

<p>They had been sitting there perhaps ten or
fifteen minutes, watching the torch carried
by the leader of the British force bobbing
about in the swamp, when they suddenly heard
voices right near them. The next moment they
saw several dark forms making their way through
the timber. The two listened to the conversation of
the strangers, and learned that they were Tories,
on their way to the home of a patriot, one John
Santon, who, it seemed, had taken into his home
a patriot school-teacher, after the latter had been
given a coat of tar and feathers.</p>

<p>The Tories were going to take the teacher out,
give him a whipping, and then give him twenty-four
hours to get out of that part of the country.</p>

<p>The Tories were walking at a slow pace, and so
the two patriots gained the above information
before the party was out of hearing.</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ what do ye say to followin’ thim
rascals an’ thryin’ to spoil their game, Fritz?”
asked Tim.</p>

<p>“I think dot is der thing to do, Tim,” was the
reply. “Der retgoads vill not be back here for
a long while, und ve can’t do anything to dena
when dey do come, for dere are too many uf
dem.”</p>

<p>“Roight ye are, an’ mebby we can help the
fellow what thim rapscallions are talkin’ av takin’
out an’ whippin’.”</p>

<p>“Mebby so, Tim. Ve vill try id, uf you say
so.”</p>

<p>“Well, Oi do say so. Let’s follow thim, me
bye.”</p>

<p>So they rose, promptly set out on the trail of
the Tories, and were soon close enough to them
to hear their conversation. As it was pretty
dark, there was not much danger of their being
discovered.</p>

<p>When the Tories reached the Santon home,
and knocked on the door, Tim and Fritz were
close at hand. They listened to the conversation
between Santon and the Tories, and when the
school-teacher was captured and the Tories
started away, with him in their midst, Tim and
Fritz moved away through the woods, keeping
the party under observation. When they came
upon the cabin in the gully, they guessed that this
might be the spot the Tories were aiming for.
So they stationed themselves behind trees near
the end of the cabin, awaiting the approach of
the party.</p>

<p>The two patriots watched the Tories, who had
lighted a torch, so as to see how to do the work
they intended doing. When they saw the ruffians
tie their prisoner to a tree, after stripping him to
the waist, and one on either side with a heavy
switch in his hand, get ready to administer a
whipping, Tim and Fritz decided that they would
not stand there and be witnesses to such an affair.
There were only five of the ruffians, and
as the two had each two pistols, they believed
they could drive the Tories away.</p>

<p>Tim whispered instructions to Fritz, both
drew their pistols, and just as the two ruffians
with the switches were about to strike, the patriots
fired their pistols.</p>

<p>Both the bullets took effect. The patriots had
not tried to kill, but they wanted to wound the
Tories, and succeeded. They had aimed at the
two who were holding the switches, and at the
sound of the reports the two ruffians uttered exclamations
of pain and amazement. Dropping
the switches, they staggered away from their intended
victim.</p>

<p>“Foire ag’in, comrades, an’ thin charge the
spalpanes!” cried Tim at this instant, and firing
the other two pistols, they succeeded in wounding
Sprowl, whose howl of pain was loud and
prolonged. Then the ruffians all hastened away,
the two that were not injured running swiftly
ahead, while the others traveled as fast as they
could.</p>

<p>“Afther thim!” yelled Tim, loudly, to add to
the fright of the fleeing Tories, but in a low voice
to Fritz he said: “Don’t follow thim. We’ve
got thim running, an’ so let thim go. We’ll set
this poor chap free.”</p>

<p>He stepped to the spot and cut the rope binding
Miller to the tree. The teacher was grateful
to his new found friends and thanked the two
heartily. “You have done me a great kindness,”
he said, “and I appreciate it, I assure you.
Those ruffians would have given me a terrible
beating had you not intervened.”</p>

<p>“They looked capable av doin’ thot, sir,” said
Tim.</p>

<p>“Yah, dey vos mean-loogin’ fellers, und dot is
so,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Yes, those same scoundrels gave me a coat
of tar and feathers this afternoon,” continued
Miller. “But they were not satisfied with that,
it seems, but wanted to give me a beating.”</p>

<p>“Well, we gave thim a little somethin’ to remimber
this affair by, Oi’m thinkin’,” chuckled
Tim.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did. And, now, who are you,
if I may ask, and where are you from? I don’t
think you live in this part of the country.”</p>

<p>“We are soldiers,” said Fritz. “Ve belong
mit der army.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was a patriot army in
this part of the country,” said Miller.</p>

<p>“We just got here,” explained Tim. “There
is a rigimint, an’ it is encamped about twinty
miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Ve haf come down here to fighd Arnold,”
said Fritz.</p>

<p>“That is good. He has been causing the patriots
a lot of trouble since he came down into
Virginia.”</p>

<p>“Thot is what we have understood,” said Tim,
“An’ we have seen some av their work,
already.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” with an air of interest.</p>

<p>“Well, ye know there is a patriot sittlemint a
couple av moiles from here, av coorse.”</p>

<p>“Yes. What about it?”</p>

<p>“Why, a party av about twenty ridcoats wint
there, this avenin’, intendin’ to rob the sittlers
an’ burn the houses, but whin they got there, the
sittlers were all gone, an’ had taken their household
goods wid thim.”</p>

<p>“Ah, they must have been warned of the approach
of the redcoats. I am glad of that.”</p>

<p>“Yis, an’ they wint into a swamp thot is
about a moile or so from the sittlemint.”</p>

<p>“Ah, they will likely be safe there.”</p>

<p>“Ve ain’d so sure abouid dot,” said Fritz.
“Der retgoads haf followed der settlers into der
swamp.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” exclaimed Miller.
“That is bad.”</p>

<p>“Yis, so it is,” agreed Tim. “Fritz an’ mesilf
were goin’ to stay at the place where the
path inters the swamp, an’ wait till the ridcoats
came out, an’ learn what success they had, but
thot party av Tories came past, an’ we heard thim
talkin’ about givin’ a rebel school-teacher a whippin’,
an’ so, thinkin’ we could mebby do more
good by followin’ thim, we did so.”</p>

<p>“And I’m glad you did. But, supposing we
go to the point where the path enters the swamp?
The redcoats are likely not back out of the
swamp yet, and--”</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of musket-shots
came to their hearing, and Tim exclaimed
“They’re foightin’, now!”</p>

<h1 id='t2308'>CHAPTER XI—The Tories Again</h1>

<p>“You are right,” said Miller. “I hope
the settlers will be able to drive the redcoats
away from the island.”</p>

<p>“Mebby dey vill be able to do dot,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Let’s load our pistols and go to the point
where the path reaches the mainland,” said Tim.
“Oi would loike to be there whin the ridcoats
get back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s go at once,” said Miller. “But,
if you don’t mind, we will go past the Santon
home. It isn’t much out of our way, and I want
them to know that I was rescued from the hands
of the Tories and was not injured.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have plinty av toime to do thot, an’
thin get to our destination before the ridcoats get
there,” said Tim.</p>

<p>So they set out, and presently reached the home
of the Santons. The family was still up, and
when they saw Miller, free and uninjured, they
were delighted. When told that the two patriots,
Tim Murphy and Fritz Schmockenburg, had rescued
the teacher and driven the Tories away,
after wounding three of them, the Santons shook
hands with the patriot soldiers and complimented
them on their good work.</p>

<p>Then Miller explained about the affair at the
patriot settlement, how the patriots were on the
island in the swamp, how the redcoats had followed
them there, and that the sound of firing
had come from that direction, so it was likely
that a fight was taking place between the settlers
and the redcoats.</p>

<p>“And we are going to the point where the
path joins the mainland, so as to be there when
the British soldiers return, with the hope that
we may be able to learn how the affair came
out,” said Miller in conclusion.</p>

<p>“I would go with you, but I think that I had
better stay here, for fear those Tories, angry
by the treatment these men gave them, might
come here to get revenge on me,” said Mr. Santon.</p>

<p>“I would advise that you fasten the doors,”
said Miller. “Though the rascals may not
bother you.”</p>

<p>“Av they do come, ye foire two or three shots,
an’ we’ll get here as quick as possible,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Yah, ve vill come und shoots der Tories a
few more times,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will fire the signal shots, if the
Tories put in an appearance,” said Mr. Santon.</p>

<p>Then the three said good-night and took their
departure, promising to return after the redcoats
came back out of the swamp and tell the Santons
what had taken place on the island.</p>

<p>When the three reached a point near where
the path stretched from, the mainland, they found
all quiet, and settled down securely hidden to
await the return of the enemy. The firing had
ceased, and so the fight was either suspended or
had ended.</p>

<p>The three were eager to learn whether the patriots
had held the redcoats at bay and driven
them back, or not, and hoped that such had been
the case.</p>

<p>They sat there, talking in low tones, and keeping
a sharp lookout toward the interior of the
swamp, and presently they caught sight of a light
bobbing about in the swamp. The redcoats were
returning.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know how the affair turned out,”
said Miller.</p>

<p>“Yah, so ve vill,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>Closer and closer drew the light, and presently
the voices of the soldiers could be heard distinctly.
Listening eagerly, the three patriots
learned that the redcoats had failed in their
attempt to reach the island, and that they had been
driven back with two or three of their number
wounded.</p>

<p>“We had better move further back into the
woods,” said Miller.</p>

<p>“Yis, thot will be best,” said Tim.</p>

<p>The three rose and made their way back into
the forest a further distance of twenty-five or
thirty yards, and took up positions behind trees.
Here they stood, waiting, and when the redcoats
came onto the mainland, and stopped and settled
down, as if to make a camp for the night, the
three slipped up nearer, and were enabled to hear
the conversation of the British soldiers.</p>

<p>They learned how the redcoats had been driven
back with comparative ease by the patriots on the
island, owing to the fact that the path was so
narrow only two or three of the soldiers could
advance at a time. And they learned also that
it was the intention of the redcoats to establish
a siege and try to starve the patriots into surrendering.</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ the spalpanes are determined to get
their han’s on the household goods av’ the patriots,”
said Tim in a low voice to Miller, who
replied in a whisper that such seemed to be the
case.</p>

<p>Then, after a few minutes, the three patriots
withdrew to a distance great enough so that their
voices could not be heard by the redcoats, and
held a council. After due consideration, it was
decided that they could do no good by remaining
there, and finally Tim was struck with a bright
idea, which was that he or Fritz should return
to the encampment of the patriot force and get a
company of soldiers to come to the rescue of the
settlers in the swamp. He wondered why he
had not thought of it before.</p>

<p>“Which av us shall go, Fritz?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I vould go,” was the reply, “but you gan
go faster as vot I gan, Tim, so mebby you vos
better go.”</p>

<p>“All roight, I’ll go,” said Tim. “An’ you two
fellows will go to the Santon home, Oi suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will go there, for to-night, at any
rate,” replied Miller. “We could do nothing
here, and we might be of assistance to Mr. Santon,
if the Tories come back to bother him.”</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is so,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“All roight. Well, I’ll be goin’. Good-by,
me byes.”</p>

<p>They said good-by, and Tim set out through
the woods in the direction of the patriot encampment,
while Miller and Fritz made their way toward
the home of the patriot, John Santon.</p>

<p>Miller and Fritz walked at a moderate pace,
and when they drew near the Santon home, they
heard the sound of pounding, as of somebody
hammering against the door with a club. They
hastened forward when they heard this, for they
guessed that the Tories had again put in an appearance.</p>

<p>Such proved to be the case, for they heard a
gruff voice calling to Santon to come and open
the door or it would be broken down, and pistols
in hand--Fritz having given one of his to Miller--they
advanced till within about ten yards
of the Tories, of whom there seemed to be five
or six. Then pausing, they leveled their pistols
and fired. Immediately afterward they dashed
forward, yelling at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>The shots, followed by the yells of the two,
coming so unexpectedly, startled the Tories
greatly, and with exclamations of amazement
and dismay they fled at the top of their speed,
disappearing around the corner of the house very
quickly.</p>

<p>The two patriots followed to the corner of
the house, where they paused, shouting and yelling
in the loudest and fiercest voice they could
command. Then they listened and heard the
brush crackling as the fugitives ran onward at
the top of their speed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they will come back here
again,” said Miller.</p>

<p>“I don’d vos think so, minesellufs,” responded
Fritz.</p>

<p>Then they knocked on the door, and Miller
called out: “Open the door, Mr. Santon. It is
Miller and one of the patriot soldiers that was
here a while ago.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of the bar being taken
down within, and then the door was opened by
Mr. Santon.</p>

<p>“Come in,” invited the patriot. “I’m glad
you came just when you did, for those Tories
were crying fierce threats, and would likely have
handled me roughly, had they got hold of
me.”</p>

<p>“Veil, uf dey don’d vos fall und break their
necks runnin’ through der timber, id vill be
funny,” said Fritz. “I don’d think dey vill be
back to bother you again to-night.”</p>

<p>“I hope that you are right,” said the patriot,
and then, when they had entered, he shut the door
and put the bar in place again.</p>

<p>The other members of the family were still
up, and they gave Miller and Fritz a joyous
welcome. It was evident that they were glad
to see the two, and that they felt much safer
with them there.</p>

<p>“Did you learn how the affair at the island
in the swamp turned out, Mr. Miller?” asked
Lizzie Santon, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “The patriot settlers
succeeded in driving the redcoats away.” And
then he told what they had learned by listening
to the conversation of the British soldiers after
their return from their unsuccessful attempt to
reach the island in the swamp.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad to hear that the patriot
families are safe!” exclaimed Mrs. Santon.</p>

<p>“Yes, but they are still in danger,” said
Miller. And he told how the redcoats were
going to keep up a siege. But he also told how
Tim Murphy had gone to get a company of
patriot soldiers to come and drive the raiders
away, and rescue the patriots. He added that
he did not have any doubts but that this would
be done successfully.</p>

<h1 id='t2563'>CHAPTER XII—The Pathfinders</h1>

<p>Next morning, after breakfast, Fritz
Schmockenburg and Herbert Miller said
they would go and reconnoiter the enemy’s
position, and see what they were doing.</p>

<p>“Be careful,” said Mr. Santon. “Don’t run
into any of the enemy’s traps.”</p>

<p>“We will be careful,” said Miller.</p>

<p>“Yah, ve von’t let dem gatch us,” confidently
rejoined Fritz.</p>

<p>So they said good-by, took their departure,
and in about twenty minutes were close enough
to the British to see that all was quiet in the
encampment.</p>

<p>The redcoats were sitting around, talking and
taking it easy, and did not seem to have any
fear of being attacked, for they did not have
any sentinels posted. Doubtless they had not
yet learned that a patriot regiment was in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>“They’re going to stay there and watch the
path, and keep the patriot settlers from leaving
the swamp,” determined Miller. “Doubtless
the settlers have not very much in the way of
food supplies with them on the island, and the
redcoats figure on starving them out.”</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is der vay uf id, I bet you,” said
Fritz.</p>

<p>Miller was silent and thoughtful a few minutes,
and then said: “I wonder if there is another
path leading to the swamp?”</p>

<p>“Uf der vos, der patriot seddlers could leave
der island,” said the Dutch soldier.</p>

<p>“There might be a path reaching almost to the
island,” said Miller. “The path might not be
seen from the island, and yet might be reached
by making a bridge of a fallen tree, and if that
were the case, the settlers could escape.”</p>

<p>“Ve mighd loog for der path, alretty,” said
Fritz. “Ve haf nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“All right, that is what we will do, Fritz.
Come.”</p>

<p>They moved slowly and cautiously away, and
presently reached the edge of the swamp at a
point about a half of a mile from the encampment
of the British soldiers. The intervening
trees and bushes made it impossible for the redcoats
to see them.</p>

<p>They then started along the edge of the shore
of the swamp, and kept a sharp lookout for any
sign of a solid path. They went slowly, so as
to be sure and not by any possibility overlook
what they were in search of.</p>

<p>On they went, keeping their eyes on the shoreline,
and they had gone perhaps a mile further,
when they suddenly came to a point where there
was a path leading into the swamp.</p>

<p>“Here is a starting point,” called Miller, “but
how far it extends into the swamp it is impossible
to say.”</p>

<p>“Ve vill soon find ouid,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Yes, come along, Fritz. I’ll take the lead,
as I am lighter and more active than you.”</p>

<p>“All righd.”</p>

<p>They started into the swamp, and proceeded
slowly and cautiously. The path crooked this
way and that, winding and twisting about, but
gradually extending deeper and deeper into the
swamp, and the two felt encouraged to proceed.</p>

<p>“Mebby ve reach der island afder awhile,”
said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope that we may be able to do so,”
was the reply. “Or at any rate, I hope that
we may get close enough so that the intervening
space may be bridged over.”</p>

<p>“Yah, dot vould be all righd.”</p>

<p>On they went, slowly and carefully. At some
points the path was not more than a foot in
width, but so long as they had that much solid
ground under their feet they were well pleased.</p>

<p>On and still on into the swamp they went,
and when they had penetrated a quarter of a
mile, and had stopped a few minutes, to rest and
try to figure out the continuation of the path,
they suddenly heard a voice calling, it seemed,
for help.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” exclaimed Miller, in
excitement.</p>

<p>“Yah, somebody is lost der schwamp in,
alretty,” replied Fritz.</p>

<p>“Right. And likely it is one of the men from
the settlers’ party. Possibly one is trying to
reach the mainland, and has got as far as he
can--or has fallen into the bog; and is in danger
of losing his life.”</p>

<p>“Maybe dot is der vay uf id,” said Fritz.</p>

<p>“Let us hurry on,” said Miller. “Perhaps
the path we are on will take us close to the poor
fellow, and we may be able to render him some
assistance.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” agreed Fritz. “You lead der
vay, Misder Miller, und I vill keep up mit you
uf I gan.”</p>

<p>So they hastened onward, moving through the
swamp as swiftly as possible, and soon the voice
came to them louder and plainer, and Fritz
uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>“I think dot voice sounds lige der voice uf
Dick Dare, alretty,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked Miller.</p>

<p>“Yah, I am sure uf id.”</p>

<p>“Then he has tried to make his way through
the swamp and has fallen into the bog, likely, and
unless we get to him pretty soon, and render him
assistance, he may sink beneath the surface and
be smothered to death.”</p>

<p>“Let us hurry, then, Misder Miller. I don’d
vos vant Dick to ged choked mit der bog,
alretty.”</p>

<p>They hastened onward, making, for Fritz,
wonderfully fast progress, and a few minutes
later they caught sight of someone up nearly to
his arm-pits in the bog. And at sight of him an
exclamation escaped the lips of Fritz.</p>

<p>“Id is Dick!” he cried. “Und he is avay
down in der bog. Ve must save him, Misder
Miller.” Then he lifted up his voice and called
out loudly: “Dick! Dick Dare! Here ve
are. Ve haf gome to hellup you ouid.”</p>

<p>Dick looked in their direction, and caught
sight of them. “Good for you, Fritz, old comrade,”
he cried, eagerly. “Hurry and get over
here as close as possible, and help me out of
this.”</p>

<p>“Ve are goming, Dick,” said Fritz. “Lead
on, Misder Miller.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the best I can.”</p>

<p>Miller advanced as swiftly as he could, following
the winding of the path, but suddenly he
found that there was no continuation. He had
reached the end of the stretch of solid earth.
And they were still twenty-five or thirty yards
from Dick Dare.</p>

<p>“This is as far as the path extends, Mr.
Dare,” said Miller, a disappointed tone to his
voice. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know, stranger,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“If you had a rope to throw to me, you could
pull me out; but you have no rope?”</p>

<p>“No. This is a difficult proposition, sure.
But we must reach you and get you out of there,
somehow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you will have to hurry, for I don’t
like this situation at all.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to suggest?” asked
Miller.</p>

<p>“The best plan, to my mind, would be to
climb from tree to tree, till you reach this
one nearest to me, and then perhaps you can
break off a limb and reach it down to me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try that, Mr. Dare.”</p>

<h1 id='t2777'>CHAPTER XIII—In the Swamp</h1>

<p>Miller managed to spring across a boggy
place to a tree a few feet distant, and
then he climbed up into it. He worked his way
out on a limb, and got from that tree to the next
one, then on into the next tree, and kept this up
till he was in the tree nearest to Dick.</p>

<p>Then he took his knife from his pocket and
with great rapidity cut off a limb about the size
of his wrist and reached the end down to Dick.
He grasped it eagerly and held on tightly, while
Miller pulled steadily and strongly.</p>

<p>It was quite a while before the pulling had any
perceptible effect and then it was seen that Dick
was slowly but surely rising out of the bog.</p>

<p>“I guess you are going to get out, all right,
Mr. Dare,” said Miller. “There is lots of
suction to that bog, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You are gradually pulling me up, and
if I can get to that tree, I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get you there in a few minutes, Mr.
Dare.”</p>

<p>Miller kept on pulling till he got Dick out of
the bog, and then he worked his way back to the
main body of the tree, while Dick worked his
way along on the top of the bog, and presently
reached the tree. Here he stood, holding to the
tree, while he rested for a few minutes, and then
he climbed up among the branches, and was soon
beside Miller.</p>

<p>“Thank you, very much, stranger,” Dick
said. “You have saved my life.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so,” was the reply. “But you
are welcome, and I am glad to have been able
to render you assistance. All the more because
you are a friend of Fritz, yonder, so he has
told me, and he and his comrade, Tim Murphy,
rescued me from a situation almost as unpleasant
as the one I have rescued you from.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? I am surprised to see Fritz. I
left him at the patriot encampment twenty miles
from here, yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, he and his comrade, Tim
Murphy, came to this region yesterday
and they rescued me from the hands of a party
of Tories that were going to give me a whipping
with switches. They had already given me a
coat of tar and feathers the same afternoon a few
hours before.”</p>

<p>“Then of course you are a patriot.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am the school-teacher at the school
about a mile from the Tory settlement, and about
two miles from the patriot settlement. But the
Tories don’t like me, because I took the part
of the patriot children at the school, when the
Tory children were running over them, and so
they did as I have told you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you won’t teach school there any
more, then?” enquired Dick.</p>

<p>“No. I hardly know what I shall do.”</p>

<p>“Better join the patriot army,” urged Dick.</p>

<p>“I might do that. I’ll think about it anyway.”</p>

<p>Then, Dick having rested sufficiently, in the
meantime having gotten his clothing into more
presentable and comfortable shape, they began
climbing from tree to tree, and presently joined
Fritz on the end of the pathway.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you safe ouid uf der bog,
Dick,” said Fritz, seizing the youth’s hand and
shaking it vigorously. “I was afraid dot ve
gould not ged you ouid.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad you two happened around
just when you did,” said Dick. “But where is
Tim?”</p>

<p>“He vent back to der engampment last nighd,”
was the reply. “He is going to bring some uf
der solchers here to drive der retcoats avay und
let der patriot settlers come back out uf der
swamp.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That is good. The soldiers
ought to get here pretty soon, then, if he went
last night.”</p>

<p>“Yah, dey vill get here pretty soonness,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then we will go back to the mainland,
and meet them.”</p>

<p>So the three set out, following the path to the
shore, and then they made their way in a direction
that would lead them around to a point half
a mile from the encampment of the redcoats.
Here they stopped, and Dick went down to a
little stream that flowed through the woods, and
washed the remainder of the mud from off his
clothes.</p>

<p>Then he took up his position in a sunny spot
near his comrades, where his garments would
dry off quickly.</p>

<p>They had been there perhaps an hour and a
half when they saw the patriot soldiers coming.
There were about a company of the soldiers, and
at their head with great importance stamped on
every line of his freckled Irish face, strode Tim
Murphy. As they drew nearer, Dick recognized
Captain Morgan and some of the soldiers, and
knew that it was his own company that was
advancing.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the soldiers reached the
spot where Dick, Fritz and Mr. Miller were, and
halted. After greetings had been exchanged, the
situation of affairs was explained to Captain
Morgan, who listened attentively, and said that
they would advance cautiously and try to take
the redcoats by surprise.</p>

<p>“That will be the best plan, Captain Morgan,”
agreed Dick.</p>

<p>Then the party started forward, Dick, Fritz,
Tim, Mr. Miller and Captain Morgan scouting
in the lead, the soldiers following closely.</p>

<p>Forward they went, slowly, for they were
eager to take the redcoats by surprise, and presently
they caught sight of the temporary
encampment. The British soldiers were sitting about
in groups, talking and laughing, and evidently
they did not in the least suspect that they were
in danger.</p>

<p>But suddenly, as the patriots were looking, a
man had seemed to rush into the encampment
and say something in an excited manner, and
make a gesture toward where the patriot soldiers
were. Then the redcoats leaped to their feet
and seized their muskets.</p>

<p>“That fellow has warned them!” cried Captain
Morgan. “Forward, men. Charge the
redcoats!”</p>

<h1 id='t2945'>CHAPTER XIV—Routed</h1>

<p>The patriot soldiers dashed forward, running
rapidly through the heavy underbrush
that intervened, and when they were in
range, they were halted suddenly, at a command
from the captain, who promptly ordered them
to fire a volley.</p>

<p>The redcoats, seeing that a very considerably
stronger force than their own was coming, had
leaped behind trees, shielding themselves as best
they could, so that the volley fired by the patriot
soldiers did not do a great deal of damage,
wounding a few, but not killing any.</p>

<p>The British soldiers then returned the fire, but
the patriot soldiers, upon order of the Captain
were crouching low, so that only one or two received
slight flesh wounds, but no serious harm
was done.</p>

<p>Again the captain yelled for the patriot soldiers
to charge, and they did so, dashing forward at
the top of their speed. At this the redcoats
turned and fled at the top of their speed, evidently
deciding that it would not be practicable
for them to try to stand their ground.</p>

<p>After them went the patriots, firing their
pistols and yelling loudly, and the redcoats ran as
they probably had never run before. The patriot
soldiers followed them perhaps a quarter of a
mile, and then, not wishing to waste effort or
ammunition, at a command from the captain,
they stopped.</p>

<p>Returning now to the point where the raiders
had been encamped, Dick Dare said that he
would go to the island in the swamp and tell the
patriot settlers that they could now come back
to their homes, as the enemy had been driven
away.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I would prefer you would
do, Dick,” said the captain. “I wish you would
follow that party of redcoats. They will likely
return to their main encampment, and by following
them you will be enabled to learn where
Arnold’s force is. Somebody else can go to the
island and carry the news to the settlers.”</p>

<p>“True. Very well, Captain Morgan. I will
go on the trail of the British soldiers, and as
soon as I have located their encampment, I will
return and bring you the information.”</p>

<p>“Good, Dick. That will please me, for I want
to get after that traitor, Arnold.”</p>

<p>So Dick hastened away, through the forest,
following the course taken by the redcoats. He
went swiftly, for he wanted to get his eyes on the
escaping soldiers, when he would have no great
difficulty in keeping them under surveillance.</p>

<p>On he hastened, and about half an hour later
he caught sight of the red uniforms of the
soldiers bobbing about between the trees in front
of him.</p>

<p>“There they are,” murmured Dick, slackening
his pace. “Good. Now I can follow them
without much trouble.”</p>

<p>The party continued on southward till they
were nearly to the James River, and then they
turned toward the east, and went in that direction
several miles. Coming to an open spot on
the top of a knoll, when they were at a distance
of perhaps ten miles from the encampment by
the swamp, that they had recently quitted so
hurriedly, they again went into camp.</p>

<p>Dick stopped and from a position behind a
tree, watched them with a feeling of disappointment.
“They don’t seem to have any intention
of going to the main encampment, yet awhile,
anyhow,” he murmured. “Well, I will stay
here and keep watch on them, and perhaps later
on they will go to the British camp.”</p>

<p>The redcoats remained where they were, and
when finally noon came, they ate some food that
they carried in knap-sacks, and this made Dick
feel hungry. He had come away in such a hurry
that he had not thought of food.</p>

<p>He was determined not to lose sight of the
British soldiers, however, so he stuck to his post,
and waited for them to continue their journey.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon Dick heard
the sound of voices from behind him, and
turned around quickly--to see Tom and Ben
coming through the timber!</p>

<p>“Well, if there don’t come the boys!” he
murmured. “Now, I will have company, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Fearing that the redcoats up on the top of the
knoll might hear the voices of the youths, or
catch sight of them, Dick hastened to meet the
two, and when they discovered him, he made a
cautioning gesture to which they gave heed for
they stopped and waited for him to join them.</p>

<p>“Have you found the encampment of Arnold,
Dick?” asked Tom, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply. “The party of redcoats
that we chased away have stopped here
and gone into camp. I’m waiting for them to
continue their journey.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad we caught up with you and
we have brought you rations.”</p>

<p>“Which is most welcome news.”</p>

<p>They settled down behind a clump of bushes,
and took it easy while Dick filled, in some degree,
the empty void within him. They could peep
through between the bushes and see the redcoats
on the knoll; and Tom and Ben now told Dick
that Tim and Fritz had come to the island and
brought the news that the patriot soldiers were
there and had driven the redcoats away.</p>

<p>“The patriot settlers came back to the mainland
and went to their homes again,” said Tom.
“And the soldiers are encamped at the settlement,
where they will stay till we get back with
the news of the whereabouts of Arnold’s main
encampment.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ben. “What luck did you have,
Dick, climbing through the tops of the trees?”</p>

<p>Dick then told them of his experience in the
bog, and how Fritz and Herbert Miller had
come to his rescue, just when he had begun to
think he would perish in the bog.</p>

<p>“It was lucky that they happened to find that
path and were trying to reach the island,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was my only salvation. There was
near to being an end to Dick Dare.”</p>

<p>Slowly the time rolled away, and evening
came, with the redcoats still encamped on the top
of the knoll. As soon as it was dark, Dick
crept up close to the encampment, and after
listening a while, succeeded in hearing enough
of the conversation of the soldiers to learn that
it was their intention to remain there all night.</p>

<p>Dick made his way back to where Tom and
Ben were and told them the news. “Such being
the case,” he said, “we don’t need to stay right
here and keep watch on the camp all the time.
We will go and find a settler’s home and get
something to eat.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” said Tom. “I am beginning
to feel pretty hungry.”</p>

<p>“I could enjoy a bite, myself,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Come, then,” said Dick. “We’ll see if we
can find a place where we can get something to
eat.”</p>

<p>He set out through the woodland with Tom
and Ben close beside him. They traveled thus
for perhaps half an hour, during which time
darkness overtook them, then they suddenly
caught sight of lights, through between the trees.</p>

<p>“There’s a little settlement!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s something going on at one
of the houses,” said Ben. “See, that house near
the center is lighted up more than the others,
and I hear music.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a violin,” said Tom. “Likely
they are having a party there.”</p>

<p>The youths were soon close to the house in
question, and saw that there were a number of
young people, young men and girls, in the front
room, dancing to the music from a violin.</p>

<p>“A dance!” exclaimed Tom. “Let’s go in,
boys, and enjoy ourselves a while.”</p>

<p>The other two willingly agreed. It was not
often that they had found opportunity for
amusement, so advancing to the door, Dick
knocked.</p>

<h1 id='t3161'>CHAPTER XV—At the Dance</h1>

<p>The door was opened, presently, and a
woman of middle age stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Good evening, ma’am,” said Dick, bowing.
“Myself and comrades would like to get something
to eat, if you have any food to spare. We
will pay for the food.”</p>

<p>“Come right in,” was the cordial reply.
“There is plenty of food in the house and you
will be welcome to all you can eat. Come in.”</p>

<p>The youths entered, and the woman led the
way to the kitchen, along a hall, past the room
in which the young people were dancing. Here
she invited the youths to be seated, and began
placing food on a table.</p>

<p>“You don’t belong in these parts, do you?”
she asked, looking with some show of curiosity
at the youths.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” replied Dick. And then he
asked, somewhat hesitatingly: “Is this--are
the people around here, loyal to the king, or are
they inclined to be patriotic?”</p>

<p>The woman looked at Dick rather sharply, and
then after hesitating slightly, she said: “Well,
I don’t know just what to say, young man. You
see, General Arnold has an army of British
soldiers about twenty miles from here, and some
of his soldiers have even come this far and done
some plunderin’ of patriot settlers, and--well,
mebby it wouldn’t be best to say whether we are
patriots or Tories. I don’t know whether you
are patriots or not, either,” with another searching
glance.</p>

<p>Dick shrewdly guessed, from her words and
actions, that she was a patriot, and so he said:
“We are patriots, ma’am, so you needn’t be
afraid to say you are a patriot.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” with a relieved air.
“What are your names, and where do you
live?”</p>

<p>Dick told her their names, and said that they
were soldiers, belonging with a regiment of
patriot soldiers that was in that part of the country,
having come there recently from the North.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad there is a patriot army in
this part of the country too,” said the woman.
“Maybe they will be able to put a stop to the
plundering and burning of the homes of the
patriot settlers around here.”</p>

<p>“I think that we shall be able to do so,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>The food was on the table by this time, and
the three youths needed no further invitation to
move up their chairs and to eat heartily of the
good things provided. The woman stood near,
waiting on them, and talking eagerly. She asked
many questions about the patriot army, and
asked if the youths thought the patriot people
of America would win their independence. And
Dick told her he thought they would. “Washington
is a great general,” said Dick, “and I
believe he will bring about the defeat of the
British before many months have passed.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said the woman.</p>

<p>While the youths were eating, a pretty girl of
perhaps seventeen or eighteen years entered the
room, and she looked surprised when she saw the
three strangers. The woman motioned to her
to come nearer, and then she said to the youths:
“This is my daughter, Sally Hart. Sally, these
young men are Dick and Tom Dare and Ben
Foster.” She indicated each as she spoke their
names, and the girl bowed to each, and the
youths saluted in return.</p>

<p>“They are patriot soldiers, Sally,” said the
woman. “They belong with a patriot army that
has just come down here from the North, and
now Arnold and his redcoats will have to be careful
or they will get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” said Sally, smiling.
“And I am glad to make the acquaintance of
you young men.”</p>

<p>The youths assured her that the pleasure was
mutual, and then she asked a few questions
about the patriot army, after which she invited
the three to spend the evening there and take part
in the dancing.</p>

<p>“We shall be very glad to have you stay,” she
said. “Most all that are here are patriots, so
they will be glad to make your acquaintance.
Stay and dance, and later on we will have a big
supper.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel as if I would want any more
food to-night,” said Dick, smiling. “And
indeed I feel almost too full to move. But perhaps
a little later I shall be able to dance a little.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will be able to eat another supper
by the time it is ready,” said Sally, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps so. Thank you for the kind
invitation, Miss Hart.”</p>

<p>“It will be a pleasure for us to have you
spend the evening with us,” said the girl.
“When you are ready, we will go into the other
room, and I will introduce you to the young
folks.”</p>

<p>The youths soon finished eating, and were
ready to accompany the girl, and as soon as they
were in the other room, where they were quickly
the objects of surprised scrutiny from all present,
Sally introduced them, and explained briefly
how they happened to be present.</p>

<p>They were given a cordial welcome by the
young people, the girls bowing to them, and the
youths stepping up and shaking hands with them
in a hearty manner.</p>

<p>Dick, Tom and Ben were feeling quite at
home in a few minutes, and when the musician
struck up a tune on his violin a few minutes
later, they were ready to dance, having invited
a partner from among their new friends. They
were quickly out on the floor, taking part in the
dancing.</p>

<p>Dick and Sally at the outset were partners.
He found her a good dancer, and a pleasant companion
as well. They talked and laughed as
they whirled about the room, and were soon very
well acquainted indeed.</p>

<p>The three patriot youths danced every set after
that, and enjoyed themselves hugely, but when
they had been there an hour or so, there came
an interruption: The front door was suddenly
thrown open and into the room strode ten British
soldiers.</p>

<p>“What’s going on here?” cried one, who
wore the uniform of a sergeant. “You young
people seem to be enjoying yourselves greatly,
and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>Dick, Tom and Ben were naturally somewhat
dismayed, for they thought possibly the British
soldiers had seen them as they were coming away
from the vicinity of their encampment, and had
followed with the intention of capturing them.</p>

<p>As the redcoats did not take any particular
notice of the three, however, they decided that
they were mistaken in their supposition, and that
the British soldiers had just happened in at the
settlement, the same as had been the case with them.
Dick, Tom and Ben had on citizen’s clothing, so
there was nothing to make the redcoats suspect
them of being patriot soldiers. Doubtless the
British intruders supposed the three to be residents
of the settlement, the same as the other
youths present. Having come to this conclusion
the three patriot youths breathed more freely,
and the feeling of dismay left them.</p>

<p>The soldiers insisted that they liked to dance,
and so the music was started up again, and soon
the dance was going merrily on, with the redcoats
almost monopolizing the floor. The next
set, however, only five of the redcoats danced,
the others looking on, and Dick, who was dancing,
saw one of the youths, Ralph Hicks, whisper
something to the sergeant, after which the
two left the room together. Dick’s suspicions
were aroused at once, for Sally had given Dick
to understand that Hicks was her “fellow,” as
she put it. As Dick had danced with Sally several
times, and had seen Hicks regarding him
with a jealous frown on his face, the youth
reached the conclusion that Hicks was going to
tell the sergeant that there were three patriot soldiers
in the house. Sally had stated that Hicks
was the son of a loyalist, and this made Dick all
the more suspicious. He would not stop dancing,
however, for he thought it possible he might
be mistaken in his suspicions, and he did not
want to let the redcoats suspect that he feared
capture.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to warn Tom and Ben,
however, but just as the set was finished and
Dick was leading his partner to a seat, Hicks and
the sergeant reentered. The officer hastened to
whisper something to each of the redcoats, and
as Dick turned away, after seating his partner,
he found himself confronted by the sergeant and
another soldier, each with a pistol leveled at his
head. A brief glance toward Tom and Ben
showed Dick that they were threatened in the
same manner.</p>

<p>“Surrender, you rebel!” cried the sergeant.
“We arrest you, Dick Dare, in the name of the
king!”</p>

<h1 id='t3388'>CHAPTER XVI—The Bottle of Cider</h1>

<p>The girls uttered cries of fear and ran into
the other room. The young men stood
their ground, but made no move to interfere.
Doubtless they sympathized with the three youths--with
the exception of Ralph Hicks--but did
not feel like trying to fight ten British soldiers,
for the sake of the three almost strangers.</p>

<p>Dick Dare realized that it would be foolish to
try to resist or attempt an escape. The redcoats
were within arm’s-length of them, armed with
pistols, and to try to get away would be to get
bullets in their bodies before they were out of the
room.</p>

<p>So he said: “We surrender. Don’t shoot,”
and the sergeant nodded and said:</p>

<p>“That’s sensible. Turn your backs to us and
place your hands behind you.”</p>

<p>The patriot youths obeyed, and the redcoats
quickly bound their wrists with cord that was
brought to them by Mr. Hart, the man of the
house, at their command. It was easy to see
that he did not like this, but the redcoats were
strong enough so that they could do as they
wished, and protest would avail nothing.</p>

<p>The three prisoners were placed in the kitchen,
in one corner, and the sergeant confronted them,
saying: “So you rebels are down here from the
North with an army, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dick, quietly.</p>

<p>“What do you think you are going to do?”</p>

<p>“We are going to make it warm for Arnold
and his troops,” said Dick.</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled sarcastically. “I don’t
think <span class='it'>you</span> will have much to do with it,” he said.
“You are going with us to our camp, when we
leave here, and to-morrow we will rejoin the
main army, and Arnold will likely string you up
to a tree, as I have heard him speak of you as
being a rebel spy.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t got us to this encampment yet,”
said Dick, calmly.</p>

<p>“Bah. How came you to be here to-night?”</p>

<p>“That is our business.”</p>

<p>“You won’t answer, eh?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“All right. It don’t make any difference, anyway.
We’ve got you, now, so you can’t do whatever
you had the intention of doing. I judge
that likely you were searching for Arnold’s encampment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, possibly.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t have to search any longer.
We’ll see that you get there, to-morrow--and
that you stay a while, my fine young rebel.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Dick, sarcastically.</p>

<p>Then the sergeant placed a redcoat on guard,
to see that the prisoners made no attempt to escape,
after which he returned to the front room,
and the dancing was started up again, and went
on with seeming merriment. But the fact was,
that the young people were not enjoying themselves
as much as had been the case before the
advent of the redcoats.</p>

<p>Sally Hart was a bright, shrewd girl. She
had noted the fact that Ralph Hicks and the sergeant
had left the room together a while before
the three patriot youths were made prisoners, and
she guessed that Hicks had told the sergeant that
the three youths were patriot soldiers. She summoned
Hicks to her side, and whispered to him
that she wanted him to come out of doors with
her, that she had something to say to him privately,
and he followed her out.</p>

<p>When they were a short distance from the
house, Sally turned and said, somewhat
sternly: “Ralph, why did you tell that sergeant that the
Dare Boys and Ben Foster were patriot soldiers,
and cause them to be made prisoners?”</p>

<p>“I--why, Sally, I didn’t--”</p>

<p>“Ralph Hicks, you know you did tell him!”
interrupted Sally. “And, now, why did you do
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, Sally,” was the reply, in a desperate
tone, “if you must know, I did it because you--because,
well, you seemed to like Dick Dare, that’s
why. You danced with him four or five times,
and I didn’t get to dance with you once.”</p>

<p>“So that is the reason!” There was anger
and scorn in the girl’s voice. “I danced with
Dick Dare several times because he is a good
dancer, and because he is a stranger, and our
guest. And you had to go and get jealous and
hand him over to the redcoats. Ralph Hicks, I
have a good mind to never speak to you again!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Sally,” said Hicks. “I--well,
I was kind of mad at Dick Dare, and--and, yes,
jealous of him. I wish you were not angry with
me, Sally.”</p>

<p>“I am angry, Ralph,” was the grim reply.
“And there is just one way that you can get me
over my angry feeling toward you.”</p>

<p>“How is that, Sally?” eagerly.</p>

<p>“By securing the freedom of Dick and Tom
Dare and Ben Foster.”</p>

<p>Hicks was silent a few moments, and then
said: “I can’t do that, Sally. The redcoats
have the three prisoners, and how could I get
them out of their hands?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, that’s your problem, but if
you want me to ever speak to you, after to-night,
you must get those three young men free. You
were the cause of their being made prisoners, and
it is your place to rescue them.”</p>

<p>“But, how will I do it, Sally?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“If you will help me,” said Hicks, presently,
after a period of pondering, “perhaps I might
manage it.”</p>

<p>“What could I do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. You have some mighty fine
cider in the cellar, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll get a bottle of the cider, and will
be out here with it, and you tell the soldier that
is guarding the prisoners that if he will step out
of doors, I will give him some cider. And when
he comes out, you cut the ropes and free the prisoners,
and they can rush out, knock the redcoat
over and make their escape.”</p>

<p>“But, won’t the redcoat wonder why the cider
isn’t brought into the room and given to him
there?”</p>

<p>“Tell him there is only one bottle, and that
the other soldiers would want some of it, too, if
they saw him drinking.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Sally, after a few moments
of silence, “we will try that plan. Go down into
the cellar and get a bottle of the cider.”</p>

<p>“And--Sally.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“If we succeed in setting the prisoners free,
you’ll--you won’t be angry with me, will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see about it, Ralph. Now, go and get
the cider.”</p>

<p>Hicks said, “All right,” and then lifted the
cellar-door and made his way down into the cellar.
He got a bottle of the cider, and when he
got back up, and had closed the cellar-door, the
redcoat was just emerging from the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Hicks, his voice trembling
slightly. “Here is the cider.”</p>

<p>“All right, young man, and thank you,” said
the redcoat. He stepped to Hicks’ side, and took
the bottle, and placed it to his mouth.</p>

<p>A few moments later the door of the kitchen
opened again, and Dick and Tom Dare and Ben
Foster leaped forth. The redcoat heard them
and started to turn around, but Dick Dare, who
was in the lead, sprang upon the British soldier
with all his force, and the redcoat was hurled
sprawling to the earth, the bottle flying from his
hand.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/illus-126f.jpg'><img src='images/illus-126.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:324px;height:525px;'/></a>
<p class='caption'>The red coat was hurled sprawling.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the three youths dashed away, into the
edge of the timber at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>The redcoat was not injured, excepting that
he had been jarred by falling, and he scrambled
to his feet, caught sight of the youths running,
and jerking out a pistol, he fired a shot after the
fugitives, and yelled loudly:</p>

<p>“Quick, comrades! The prisoners have escaped!”</p>

<h1 id='t3616'>CHAPTER XVII—Arnold’s Encampment</h1>

<p>The British soldiers came dashing through
the kitchen and out by way of the rear
door, and, directed by the excited redcoat that
had permitted the prisoners to escape, through
leaving his post, they dashed through the underbrush
in pursuit of the three patriot soldiers.</p>

<p>On they ran, for quite a distance, but they
did not catch sight of the fugitives, or hear any
sound of them, so they presently, there being
naught else to do, gave up the chase and made
their way back to the house, where the young
people, greatly excited, were eagerly awaiting
their return.</p>

<p>When it was seen that the redcoats were returning
empty-handed, there was great delight
expressed by the young people, though in subdued
tones, so that the redcoats could not hear what
was said.</p>

<p>And Ralph Hicks, who had been responsible
for the capture of the three patriot youths, was
glad they had escaped, for he felt that if they had
been recaptured, Sally would have kept her word,
and never spoken to him again.</p>

<p>When all had entered the house, the sergeant
began questioning the soldier that he had left
to guard the prisoners, and the fellow said that
the prisoners had somehow gotten their hands
free, and had suddenly jumped up, knocked him
down and had dashed out of the house. He had
quickly gotten to his feet and followed them, had
then fired the shot and yelled that the prisoners
were escaping.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked puzzled, but did not say
much. “I thought that you men could tie a prisoner’s
hands so that he could not get free,” he
growled. “That was a poor job you did,
Simons.”</p>

<p>“I thought I tied their hands tight, sir,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the rebels have made their escape,
so there is no use worrying about it,” said the
sergeant. “Let’s have another dance, and then
we’ll return to camp and say nothing about it.”</p>

<p>They went back into the front room, the musician
started a tune, and they were soon dancing
with great enthusiasm. And after the dance was
over, they and the young people went into the
kitchen and ate heartily of the food that had
been prepared.</p>

<p>All that the young folks regretted was that
Dick and Tom Dare and Ben Foster, whom they
had taken a liking to, were not there to help enjoy
the supper, as they had expected would be
the case.</p>

<p>As for the three in question, they had ran onward
till they found that the redcoats had given
up the chase, when they had turned around and
made their way back to the house. And when
the young people were eating, and at the same
time wishing the patriot youths were there, the
three were near enough so that while they could
not look in through the window, they knew what
was going on. Dick, Tom and Ben would liked
to have been in there, engaged in the same pleasing
work, but fortunately they had eaten heartily
that evening, after reaching the Hart home, and
were not really hungry. So they simply watched
and waited.</p>

<p>When the soldiers and the young folks had
finished the repast, the redcoats took their departure,
and soon after they had left the house,
by way of the front door, Dick Dare opened the
rear door, and called to Sally Hart, who came
quickly, a delighted look on her face.</p>

<p>“I wanted to thank you for freeing us,” said
Dick. “It was very kind of you, and we appreciate
it, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was glad to set you free,” said Sally.
“I am a patriot girl, you know, and I didn’t
want the redcoats to take you to their camp, prisoners.”
And then she motioned toward the table,
and said: “Come on in, and have something
to eat. There is plenty of food left.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, we will do so, Miss Sally,” said
Dick. “But, I will go and make sure that the
redcoats have taken their departure. Tom, you
and Ben can go on in. I’ll be back in a few moments.”</p>

<p>Tom and Ben entered the house, and Dick
made his way around to the front, and after listening
a few moments, heard the voices of the
British soldiers, as they made their way through
the woods, toward their encampment.</p>

<p>He followed a couple of hundred yards, and
then, feeling sure that the redcoats would not
return, he went back to the house and entered
the kitchen, where Tom and Ben were already
seated at the table, eating.</p>

<p>Dick took a place beside them, and Sally waited
on the three, while the young folks stood around,
asking questions about the manner in which the
young patriot soldiers had escaped from their
pursuers.</p>

<p>When the three had finished their supper, the
young folks said they would be going home, and
they shook hands with Dick, Tom and Ben and
said good-night and went to their homes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hart invited the three patriot youths to
spend the night there, and they accepted the invitation,
though Dick said they would want to
leave early in the morning, so as to get to the
encampment of the party of British soldiers before
they broke camp and started away, as it was
his intention to follow them to the main
encampment of the British.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you up as early as you like,” said Mr.
Hart.</p>

<p>The youths were given blankets, and lay on the
floor in the big front room, and slept soundly.
They were up early, and found that Mrs. Hart
and Sally had been up some time, and that they
had breakfast on the table.</p>

<p>Dick told them that they need not have gone
to this trouble, but they said it was a pleasure to
them. The three youths ate heartily, and then
said good-by. They took their departure, promising
that they would call at the Hart home, if
ever they were in the vicinity again.</p>

<p>They made their way to the vicinity of the
British encampment, and found the redcoats
just astir and that they were getting their breakfast.</p>

<p>“We are in plenty of time,” said Dick. “We
will stay here, where we can keep a good watch
on them, and when they break camp and leave,
we will follow them.”</p>

<p>This they did, and about an hour later the redcoats
broke camp and set out through the open
country, going toward the east. The patriot
youths followed, skirting the woods, and kept
the redcoats in view, being careful, however, to
keep out of sight themselves.</p>

<p>On marched the redcoats, and always on the
trail the youths. They were feeling pretty well
satisfied, for they believed they would soon discover
the whereabouts of Arnold’s encampment.</p>

<p>About the middle of the forenoon, the three
reached the top of a high ridge, and on looking
ahead, down the slope, they saw, about half a
mile distant, in an open piece of ground of perhaps
fifty or seventy-five acres, a good-sized encampment,
which they did not doubt was the objective
point of their search. The redcoats they
had been following had just reached the camp,
and had settled down as if intending to stay.</p>

<p>“That’s Arnold’s encampment, without doubt,”
said Dick. “Well, now we must get the information
to Colonel Morris as soon as possible.”</p>

<h1 id='t3803'>CHAPTER XVIII—A Daring Attempt</h1>

<p>The youths settled down and took it easy,
while watching the encampment. They
decided to wait till afternoon, before starting back
to the patriot encampment, with the hope that
Arnold might make a move, on learning from the
soldiers that had just arrived that a patriot force
had come down into that region from the North.</p>

<p>The result justified their judgment, for soon
after noon the British soldiers began breaking
camp, as if getting ready to march a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>“Are they going to go toward our encampment,
with the purpose of making an attack, or
will they go in the other direction, I wonder?”
questioned Tom.</p>

<p>“We will wait here and see,” determined Dick.</p>

<p>“Somehow, I think they intend going in the
other direction,” asserted Ben.</p>

<p>Dick, however, shook his head. “I hardly
think so,” he said.</p>

<p>When the British force, which consisted of
perhaps fifteen hundred men, got ready, it
marched out of the encampment and came slowly
up the slope toward where the three youths were
concealed.</p>

<p>“They are going to march into the vicinity of
our encampment,” said Dick. “Well, that is all
right. Colonel Morris won’t have so far to go
to get at them.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Come, boys,” said Dick, a few moments
later. “We must not let them see us.”</p>

<p>The three set out down the slope toward the
west, and during the afternoon they kept about
a mile ahead of the redcoats, who advanced directly
toward the point where the patriot army
was encamped.</p>

<p>It was slow work for the British force to
march along poorly conditioned roads, and they
only got to the vicinity of the little settlement,
where the dance had taken place the night before,
at the hour it was time to go into camp.</p>

<p>Here they stopped and went into camp for the
night, and Dick, Tom and Ben, being certain that
the redcoats would be there till morning, made
their way to the home of the Harts, where they
were given a cordial welcome.</p>

<p>“You are back quickly,” said Mr. Hart.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dick. “We are on our way
back to the patriot encampment, and are keeping
a little distance in front of the British force,
which is marching toward the point where the
patriots are encamped.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so they are moving in that direction, are
they?” exclaimed Mr. Hart.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They are encamped about a mile
from here. They will be there till morning, and
we thought we would come over here and see you
folks.”</p>

<p>“We are glad you did. Supper will be ready
in a few minutes, and you will take supper and
stay all night with us, the same as you did last
night.”</p>

<p>“If it won’t inconvenience you too much,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>“We shall be glad to have you here,” was the
hearty reply, and Mrs. Hart and Sally said the
same.</p>

<p>When supper was ready, the six sat up to the
table and ate heartily, laughing and talking, and
had just finished when there came the sound of
knocking at the front door.</p>

<p>“Some of the redcoats have come here!” exclaimed
Dick, in a low voice. “We will slip out
at the back door, while you go to the front door
to see them, Mr. Hart.”</p>

<p>“Very well, but stay and come in as soon as
they are gone.”</p>

<p>“We will do so.”</p>

<p>The three youths passed out through the rear
exit, and Mr. Hart made his way to the front
door, which, when he opened it, revealed to his
view a couple of British officers.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sirs,” said Mr. Hart, politely.
“Will you come in?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, yes,” replied one. And they entered,
after which the officer who had spoken
said: “I am General Arnold, of the king’s
troops, sir, and this gentleman is Colonel Riggs,
of my staff.”</p>

<p>“My name is Hart,” was the reply. “I am
glad to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Then the two seated themselves, and Mr. Hart
did the same, after which General Arnold asked:</p>

<p>“I wish to inquire if there are many loyalists
in this vicinity, Mr. Hart?”</p>

<p>“I think there are quite a good many, sir,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“Do you think I could recruit my army here,
to do much good?”</p>

<p>“You might secure a few members,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“About how many, would you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps fifteen or twenty, within a radius
of five or six miles.”</p>

<p>“That would not be very much of a reinforcement,”
said Arnold. “The country around here
is not very thickly settled, then.”</p>

<p>“Not very.”</p>

<p>“There is quite a good-sized settlement about
twelve or fifteen miles to the westward, is there
not?” Arnold asked, after a few moments.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How big a settlement is it?”</p>

<p>“There are forty or fifty houses, sir.”</p>

<p>“And there is another settlement near that
one, made up mostly of rebels, is there not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, so I have understood. It is not so
large, however, having only twelve or fifteen
families.”</p>

<p>“Humph. Well, thank you, Mr. Hart. My
army is encamped near here, and I thought we
would walk over and have a talk with you, some
of my soldiers having stated that they were here
last night, at a dance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the young folks of the settlement had a
little party here last night.”</p>

<p>“My men informed me that Dick and Tom
Dare and Ben Foster, three rebel spies, were here,
and that they had them prisoners, but that they
managed to escape,” said Arnold.</p>

<p>“Yes, General Arnold. We did not know anything
about them, of course, but as they appeared
to be very nice young men, we gave them their
supper, and they took part in the festivities.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not blaming you, Mr. Hart. I was
just wishing that the rebels had not escaped. I
would have liked to have made them prisoners.”</p>

<p>They talked a while longer, and then Arnold
and his companion rose, said good-night and took
their departure.</p>

<p>“That man is a rebel, Colonel Riggs,” said
Arnold, when they were a little distance from
the house.</p>

<p>“I rather think so, myself,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Yes. He pretended that he was in sympathy
with the king, but I am pretty sure that he is at
heart a rebel.”</p>

<p>“He did not seem to be very enthusiastic when
you were asking about securing recruits in this
region,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“No. I think he wished to discourage the
idea.”</p>

<p>“It looked that way to me.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, when the two were about a quarter
of a mile from the settlement, three forms leaped
out behind them, from behind trees, and threw
themselves upon the British officers. They were
Dick and Tom Dare and Ben Foster, and they
were attempting a most daring enterprise--the
capture of General Arnold and Colonel Riggs.</p>

<p>Tom and Ben had seized the colonel, while
Dick had leaped upon Arnold, and instantly a
fierce struggle was taking place there in the underbrush.</p>

<h1 id='t4026'>CHAPTER XIX—The Armies Close Together</h1>

<p>The three patriot youths would have succeeded
in effecting the capture of Arnold
and the colonel, had it not been that four or five
British soldiers happened to be coming along the
path. They were not far distant, and were on
their way to the Hart home to get some cider.
Hearing the cries for assistance made by the British
officers they ran in the direction from which
the sound came.</p>

<p>The patriot youths heard the redcoats coming,
and recognized that it would be impossible to
make prisoners of the two officers, now that reinforcements
were at hand, so Dick and his comrades
let go of the two and ran away through the
woods at the top of their speed.</p>

<p>The officers called loudly, but did not themselves
go in pursuit. As soon however as the
soldiers reached them, they indicated the direction
taken by their assailants and the soldiers
took up the chase.</p>

<p>“I would wager anything that those scoundrels
that attacked us were the Dare Boys and
Ben Foster,” said Arnold, breathing hard.
“They are just about daring enough to attempt
such work as that.”</p>

<p>“Likely you are right,” agreed the colonel,
who also was panting for breath.</p>

<p>“I hope that the men will capture them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I have my doubts.”</p>

<p>“So do I. The young rascals are fleet of foot
and likely know the ground better than our
men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and in the darkness and amid the trees
it will be an easy matter for them to escape.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Well, let us go on to the encampment.”</p>

<p>They set out and were soon at the camp, where
they sat down for a refreshing smoke, to await
the return of the soldiers who had gone in
pursuit of the three patriots.</p>

<p>An hour and a half passed, and then two of
the soldiers arrived at camp, and reported that
they had been unable to catch the rebels.</p>

<p>“I hardly expected you would,” said Arnold,
and then he dismissed them.</p>

<p>The other soldiers failing in their efforts to
locate the boys had made their way to the Hart
home, and were given several bottles of cider,
which they drank, and then returned to camp.</p>

<p>They had scarcely gotten a hundred yards away
from the house before Dick arid Tom Dare and
Ben Foster entered at the rear door.</p>

<p>The three were given a cordial greeting, and
when they told how they had tried to capture
Arnold and his companion, Mr. Hart laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>“That was a daring attempt to make,” he said.</p>

<p>“But we would have succeeded, if the soldiers
had not come to the assistance of Arnold
and the colonel,” said Dick.</p>

<p>They talked there an hour or so, and then the
members of the Hart family went to their rooms,
while Dick, Tom and Ben slept on blankets spread
on the floor, as they had done the night before.</p>

<p>Next morning they ate an early breakfast, after
which they said good-by, and took their departure,
going over to a point from which they could
see the British encampment.</p>

<p>The soldiers were just beginning to cook
breakast, and the youths waited patiently till the
redcoats had eaten. Then when they broke camp
and started the day’s march, the youths advanced
also, keeping well ahead of the British.</p>

<p>An hour or so before noon the British had
reached a point about three miles from the
patriot settlement where the patriot army had its
quarters, but instead of going in that direction,
the redcoats bore away to the left and headed
toward the Tory settlement three miles farther to
the southward.</p>

<p>“They are going to the Tory settlement,” said
Dick. “Likely they will encamp there, and then
will figure on engaging our army in battle.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s about what they are going to
do,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, as we are within about three miles of
the patriot encampment, one of us had better go
there with the news of the presence in this vicinity
of the British army. Which of you will go?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Very well. Tell Colonel Morris that the
British are evidently going to go into camp at the
Tory settlement, and that as soon as we see that
they have done so, we will bring him word.”</p>

<p>“All right.” And then Ben hastened away
in the direction of the patriot encampment.</p>

<p>Dick and Tom made their way onward, following
now instead of preceding the British, and
remaining on their trail till they arrived at the
settlement, where, as the youths had expected,
the British stopped and went into camp.</p>

<p>“That means that they are going to stay there
a while,” said Dick. “So you go to the patriot
encampment and tell Colonel Morris the news,
Tom.”</p>

<p>“All right. You will stay here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, till nightfall, and perhaps I may be
able to secure some definite information regarding their intentions.”</p>

<p>Tom then took his departure, and made his way
toward the patriot settlement. He walked
rapidly, and in less than an hour had arrived at his
destination.</p>

<p>On entering the encampment, he asked where
Colonel Morris had his quarters, and was directed
to the Williams home, where he found the
colonel, and also Captain Morgan, who greeted
him pleasantly.</p>

<p>“You bring news of the British, my boy?”
said the colonel.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They have reached the Tory
settlement about three miles from here and have
gone into camp.”</p>

<p>“Then they are here for a campaign against
us,” said Captain Morgan.</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” agreed the colonel.
“Where is Dick Dare?” he asked, after a few
moments.</p>

<p>“He stayed there, with the intention of waiting
till after dark and trying to learn their plans.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea. How strong is their
force, do you think?”</p>

<p>“About fifteen hundred, sir, I should judge.”</p>

<p>“That is what Ben Foster said. Well, we
have a thousand men, and will be able to give
Arnold a good fight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we can hold our own against
his force,” said Captain Morgan.</p>

<p>After answering a few more questions, Tom
made his way to the point where his company
was quartered, and found Ben there. Herbert
Miller, the school-teacher, was there also, and he
informed Tom that he had joined the patriot
army.</p>

<p>“Good for you. I’m glad of that,” said Tom.</p>

<h1 id='t4216'>CHAPTER XX—Dick And Hank Sprowl</h1>

<p>Dick remained near the Tory settlement till
nightfall, and then began to figure on entering
and trying to learn something about the
intentions of the enemy. The British force was
encamped just at the edge of the settlement, and
the youth believed he could visit one of the houses
and perhaps learn something from the settler,
without being seen by any of the redcoats.</p>

<p>So he made his way into the settlement, at the
opposite side from the British encampment, and
approaching one of the houses, knocked on the
door.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a tall, rough-looking
settler appeared. He was no other, in fact, than
Hank Sprowl, Herbert Miller’s worst enemy, but
Dick, of course, did not know him.</p>

<p>“How are ye, stranger?” Sprowl said, gruffly.
“What kin I do fur ye?”</p>

<p>“I am a stranger in these parts,” replied Dick,
“and I thought that perhaps I could get something
to eat here. I will pay for the food.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s all right. Yas, I guess we kin let ye
have somethin’ to eat. Come in.”</p>

<p>Dick entered, and Sprowl motioned to a chair
after closing the door, and as the youth sat down,
he asked: “What is your name, stranger?”</p>

<p>“Dick Ford,” was the reply, Dick deciding
that he had better give a fictitious name, he being
so close to the British.</p>

<p>“Where do ye live, an’ where ye goin’?”</p>

<p>“I live about a hundred miles north from here,”
was the reply. “And I’m going about fifty
miles beyond the James River.”</p>

<p>“Got folks down there, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a stranger to supper, Molly,” called
Sprowl. “Cook enuff extra fur him.”</p>

<p>“All right, Hank,” was the response from the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“I saw what looked like a big encampment at
the edge of the settlement,” said Dick. “What
is going on? Are those men soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re British soldiers. That is General
Arnold’s army,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Ah. I suppose they intend to fight the rebel
army that I saw yesterday, fifteen or twenty
miles from here, do they?”</p>

<p>“So ye seen ther rebels, did ye? Yes, thet’s
what Arnold intends to do. The rebel army is
now at a rebel settlement about three miles from
here, an’ Arnold will git arter ’em pretty quick.”</p>

<p>“When, to-morrow, do you think?” queried
Dick.</p>

<p>Sprowl looked at the youth somewhat suspiciously.
“W’y do ye wanter know?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought that if there was likely to be
a fight in this vicinity to-morrow, I would wait
here and see it,” was the prompt reply. “I
would like to see a battle.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Hank. “So thet’s your idee, hey?
Wai, I don’ know as he’ll make an attack to-morrer,
but he will git arter ther rebels before very
long, thet’s sartin.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to stop here till the battle
does take place,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Wai, I guess ye kin stay here ef ye want
to,” said Sprowl. “Ther battle may take place
to-morrer.”</p>

<p>An idea struck Dick, and he said: “As I
said, I’m a stranger here, and wouldn’t like to
bother the British officers by asking questions,
but you could find out whether they intend to
make an attack to-morrow, or not, couldn’t you,
and if they do intend to do so, I will stay.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll stay all night, anyhow, won’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want to get up very early, and so
if you will go and find out about that to-night,
I will be much obliged. If they don’t intend to
make the attack to-morrow, or by the next day,
I will go on my way.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go over to ther encampment
arter supper an’ have a leetle talk with General
Arnold, an’ see if I can find out about ther battle.”</p>

<p>“Very well, and thank you,” said Dick. “I
have always wanted to see a battle.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Sprowl. “I never seen one,
an’ this will likely be a big one, fur Arnold has
fifteen hundred men an’ I hear thet ther rebels hev
more than a thousand.”</p>

<p>“That ought to make a lively fight,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Yas, thet’s what I think.”</p>

<p>Presently the evening repast was ready, and
the three sat up to the table in the kitchen and
ate supper. Dick was hungry, as a result of the
walking he had done that day, and he ate heartily.</p>

<p>After the meal, Sprowl smoked a pipeful of
tobacco, and then rose and stretched as he said:
“I’ll go over to ther British encampment, now,
an’ have a talk with General Arnold an’ fin’ out
about ther battle, Dick Ford. I won’t be gone
very long.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Sprowl, and thank you for
your kindness. I appreciate it, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s all right. I kinder wanter know about
ther battle, myself.”</p>

<p>Then he left the house, and Dick, sitting there
in the front room, congratulated himself on his
good luck. He would now be able to secure information
right from headquarters, and without
having to venture near the British.</p>

<p>Sprowl was soon at the house where Arnold
and his officers had taken up their quarters, and
when he had been ushered into the room where
the officers sat, talking, he explained his errand.
He had already been spoken of by the settlers
in the settlement as being one of the leading
Tories, so Arnold was willing to discuss with him
subjects of interest.</p>

<p>Sprowl, in the conversation, mentioned the
fact that there was a young stranger at his house
who had asked him to find out when the battle
would likely take place, as if it would take place
on the morrow, or next day, he would remain
and see the affair, and Arnold started, looked
thoughtfully at Sprowl for a few moments, and
then said:</p>

<p>“You say there is a young stranger at your
house now, and that he expressed a wish to know
when the battle would likely take place?”</p>

<p>“Yas, General Arnold,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“What is his name?” There was an eager
light in Arnold’s eyes.</p>

<p>Sprowl looked somewhat surprised, but answered
“He said his name was Dick Ford.”</p>

<p>Arnold started again, and smiled somewhat
grimly. “Dick Ford, eh? What kind of looking
young fellow is he? Describe him.”</p>

<p>Sprowl did so as best he could, and Arnold
nodded, and said: “I’ll wager anything that the
young fellow in question is the rebel spy, Dick
Dare.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” said one of the officers.</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure of it. And I’m going to
know for sure. Colonel Riggs, get about a dozen
men and we will go to Mr. Sprawl’s home with
him, surround the house, so that the young fellow
cannot escape, and then we will enter and
confront him. And if he is Dick Dare, as I feel
confident is the case, I shall be very glad. I owe
him a debt for trying to capture me up in New
York City two or three months ago, and we both
owe him something for trying to make prisoners
of us last evening. Come, let us hasten, for he
may take the alarm and take refuge in flight.”</p>

<p>They went out, and Colonel Riggs ordered a
squad of the soldiers to go with them to Sprowl’s
house, which they surrounded, and then Arnold
and Riggs followed Sprowl into the house,
where, sure enough, they saw Dick Dare sitting
in the room, quietly awaiting the return of
Sprowl.</p>

<p>Arnold and the colonel confronted the youth,
and the general said, sarcastically: “So you
wanted Mr. Sprowl to secure some information
regarding my intentions, did you, Dick Dare?
Very good. I have come to give you the information
in person.”</p>

<h1 id='t4434'>CHAPTER XXI—Tom Reconnoiters</h1>

<p>Herbert Miller left the patriot encampment
about the middle of the afternoon,
and went to the Santon home, where he
was given a cordial greeting by Mr. and Mrs.
Santon and Lizzie.</p>

<p>“You are not teaching school, now, Mr. Miller?”
said Mr. Santon, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply, “I guess that I won’t
teach any more for a while. I have joined the
patriot army.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>“You will be safe from the hands of the
Tories of the settlement, anyway,” said Lizzie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miller, “but I don’t believe you
folks had better stay here. There will be a battle
between the British and our army, possibly
to-morrow, and it may take place right in this
vicinity. So I have come to have you folks return
with me to the patriot settlement, where you
will be safe.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think we would be in danger
here?” asked Mrs. Santon.</p>

<p>“Yes I do,” replied the young man. “When
the battle begins, bullets will fly pretty thick, and
as our army has two or three field-pieces, there
may be a few cannon-balls flying through the air,
and if the battle was to take place near here, the
house might be riddled. You folks would doubtless
be injured and would stand a chance, I fear,
even to lose your lives.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go to the settlement with Mr.
Miller,” said Mrs. Santon, who was of a somewhat
nervous disposition.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Santon. And then
they gathered together such of the household effects
as they might require, and set out for the
settlement.</p>

<p>The Santons had friends in the settlement, and
were taken into the home of one of the residents.
Herbert Miller was much better satisfied than
he would have been had they remained in their
home.</p>

<p>That evening and night passed quietly, but
Dick Dare did not put in an appearance.</p>

<p>“I fear he has been captured,” said Colonel
Morris addressing the captain of Dick’s
company. The latter nodded, and said that it
seemed probable that this was the case.</p>

<p>They were still talking about this matter, when
the orderly announced Tom Dare, and a few
moments later Tom was in the room.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, what is it?” asked the
colonel.</p>

<p>“I have come to ask what you think about
Dick not having returned,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“We were just discussing the matter,” was
the reply. “What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>“It looks as if Dick has been made a prisoner,
sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“That is what we thought.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have come to ask if I may go
and reconnoiter the British encampment. Perhaps
I may be able to learn something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you may go. But be discreet, and
don’t yourself fall into their clutches.”</p>

<p>“I will be careful, sir.”</p>

<p>Then Tom saluted and withdrew, and was
soon making his way through the forest in the
direction of the Tory settlement and British
encampment.</p>

<p>He passed the Santon home, and later on the
schoolhouse where Herbert Miller had taught,
and presently he came in sight of the settlement.</p>

<p>He paused and took a careful survey of the
surroundings, and then, after a few moments he
made his way around and approached the British
encampment.</p>

<p>He moved forward till as close as he thought
he dared venture, then he paused behind a big
tree and began a careful study of the camp.</p>

<p>He could see the redcoats lolling about in the
tents, but he did not see any signs of Dick, nor
did he see any soldiers acting as if guarding any
one of the tents, in which a prisoner might be
placed. Tom was puzzled.</p>

<p>“I fear Dick is surely in there, a prisoner,”
he murmured. “Well, if he is, I can’t rescue
him. Now, what shall I do?”</p>

<p>He decided to stay around in the vicinity and
keep watch on the encampment. The redcoats
might make some kind of a move, and he could
then carry the information to Colonel Morris.</p>

<p>It was slow work for Tom, who was of a
lively, active disposition, but by leaving his post
occasionally and taking a walk through the
timber a distance of a mile or so, and then
returning, he managed to stick to the work.</p>

<p>When noon came, he grew hungry, but had
not thought to bring food with him, so he had
to go without any. He stood it till about the
middle of the afternoon, and then as everything
was quiet in the camp, he decided to return to
the patriot encampment and get something to eat,
make his report to Colonel Morris, and then
once more to resume his self-imposed task. He
must determine what had become of his brother.</p>

<p>This he did, and when he had reported and
had feasted to his heart’s content, he fixed up a
package of provisions and again set out. He
told Miller and Ben Foster that he might remain
away till morning. Ben wanted to accompany
him, but Tom said he could reconnoiter better
alone, and so Ben remained at the camp.</p>

<p>Tom was back in the vicinity of the British
encampment in about an hour’s time, and
approaching cautiously, took up his position
behind a tree and watched the redcoats.</p>

<p>Everything seemed quiet, and he decided that
they did not intend making any move that day.
After supper that evening, however, he noted
that the soldiers began to move about energetically,
that they were examining their muskets,
and seemed to be getting ready for an enterprise
of some kind.</p>

<p>“I believe that under cover of the night they
are going to make an attack on the patriot
army,” was his thought. “If so, I must get
there ahead of them and warn Colonel Morris.”</p>

<p>Presently there could be no doubt that the
British were going to make a move, and Tom
waited eagerly till they left the camp and marched
cautiously in the direction of the patriot encampment.
Then he set out on the run in the
same direction. He made a detour, however,
to get around the British and he ran so swiftly
that in about half an hour he was at camp
headquarters, and promptly made his report.</p>

<p>“So the British are coming to attack us!”
exclaimed the colonel. “Well, all right. We’ll
be ready for them.” Then he gave instructions
to the various officers, and soon the patriot
soldiers were arranged in the best possible
positions to repel the attack of the enemy.</p>

<p>Ten or fifteen minutes later the redcoats
appeared, and came charging through the settlement,
firing their muskets as they came.</p>

<p>Thanks to the warning they had received of
the coming of the British, however, the patriots
were not taken by surprise, and the former’s
fire was returned.</p>

<p>And then the crash of the musketry and the
occasional roar of the cannon made a terrible
din on the night air.</p>

<p>The battle between the British and the patriots
was on.</p>

<h1 id='t4632'>CHAPTER XXII—The Battle</h1>

<p>It was a lively battle, indeed, for the British,
being considerably stronger than the patriots,
evidently thought they could defeat them, but
the defenders were in a strategically good
position. They sent back volley for volley, and
had the advantage of the field-pieces, and so
after a battle of about an hour and a half the
redcoats retreated, carrying their dead and
wounded with them.</p>

<p>The patriot loss was twelve killed and sixteen
wounded, and they were pretty sure that the
British had suffered a greater loss than this.</p>

<p>When the battle was over, it was found by the
soldiers in Captain Morgan’s company that Tom
Dare was missing. At first it was feared that
he had been killed, but his body was not found,
and when the captain made inquiries of the
youth’s comrades, they said that they did not
remember having seen him during the battle.</p>

<p>Ben Foster had not thought anything about
this at the time, but now he remembered that
Tom had not been by his side, and he could not
think what had become of him.</p>

<p>Nor had Tim Murphy or Fritz Schmockenburg
seen Tom, and they, like Ben, were uneasy
regarding him.</p>

<p>There was only one possible solution, that Ben
could think of, and that was, that Tom had
slipped away and gone to the British encampment,
in the hope that he might be able to rescue
Dick, while the British were away.</p>

<p>The more Ben thought of this, the more certain
he became that this was where Tom had gone,
and he asked Captain Morgan to permit him to
go to the British encampment and reconnoiter.
He thought that if Tom had gone there, he
might need assistance.</p>

<p>The captain consented that Ben should go,
but urged due caution.</p>

<p>“I will exercise care, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Then Ben took his departure, and made his
way in the direction of the enemy’s camp. When
he reached the vicinity of the old schoolhouse,
where Herbert Miller had taught, he was surprised
and attacked suddenly by about a dozen
redcoats, who rushed out of the schoolhouse,
and was made a prisoner.</p>

<p>He was ordered to enter the schoolhouse,
where he found a number of British soldiers
lying on blankets, many so severely wounded that
it had been thought best to leave them there,
fearing they could not be safely taken a further
distance. The other soldiers, who had seized
Ben, had been left there to take care of the
wounded.</p>

<p>Ben was placed on a bench, his hands tied
together behind his back, and one of the redcoats
asked him who he was and where he was
going.</p>

<p>“I live in this vicinity,” said Ben. “I was
on my way to the settlement.”</p>

<p>The redcoat laughed sneeringly. “That will
do to tell,” he said. “But I don’t believe you.
You are a rebel and were on your way to spy
on the British army.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I guess I shall have to
take you to General Arnold.”</p>

<p>Ben made no reply, and the redcoat, who wore
a lieutenant’s uniform, summoned a couple of
soldiers, ordering them to take the prisoner to
the British encampment, and to General Arnold.</p>

<p>“And don’t let him escape on the way there,”
was the caution. “I am inclined to think he is
a rebel spy.”</p>

<p>“He won’t get away,” was the reply, and the
two redcoats set out, with Ben walking between
them.</p>

<p>At first they held to his arms, but when they
had gone a little distance, they changed their
positions, one walking in front and one behind
Ben, and without holding to him.</p>

<p>Doubtless they thought that the prisoner
would not think of trying to escape, with his
hands bound. But Ben at once made up his
mind to try to get away. He was an exceedingly
swift runner, and he believed that even
with his hands bound, he could outrun any redcoat,
the majority of whom, in the lower ranks,
were clumsy fellows. So watching till they came
to a point where the ground sloped away, making
it easy for speeding, Ben suddenly leaped backward
against the soldier behind him, upsetting the
fellow, who had not been expecting anything of
this kind. Then Ben dashed away, down the
slope at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>“After him!” yelled the redcoat who had been
upset, as he scrambled hastily to his feet and
drew a pistol. “Don’t let him escape.”</p>

<p>The other had heard his comrade give utterance
to an exclamation as he went down, and
had whirled just after Ben dashed away. Now
he set out in pursuit, with the other redcoat
eight or ten yards behind.</p>

<p>Down the slope Ben ran with great swiftness,
when the fact is taken into consideration that his
wrists were tied together behind his back, and
he held his own against his pursuers. They
were not able to gain on him.</p>

<p>On he ran, and when he had gone perhaps
half a mile, he suddenly came to the edge of the
high bank of a creek that probably emptied into
the James River. It was at least thirty feet
down to the water, and being unable to stop,
Ben went over the edge of the bank. Down he
shot, a distance of perhaps ten or twelve feet,
where he struck on an outjutting ledge about
four feet wide, and fell. Fortunately he rolled
toward the face of the creek-bank, the ledge
sloping downward, and kept on rolling till he
was several feet inside a cave. And just then
down came a great mass of earth and bushes,
covering the ledge and choking up the entrance
to the cave, shutting out the light and making
it almost as dark as night within. Some heavy
stones, with a great splash, fell into the water
of the creek.</p>

<p>The redcoats had stopped before reaching the
edge of the bank, and approaching cautiously to
the point where the bank had caved off, looked
down. They saw the great mass of earth
extending from the ledge on down to the creek,
and seeing nothing of Ben, one suggested that
he had been buried under the miniature landslide,
and was now smothered to death. But
this idea was scouted as unlikely, rather it was
thought that the runaway had fallen into the
water and was drowned. They discussed the
matter a few moments, the sound of their voices
coming to Ben’s hearing in faint murmurs, and
then they turned and made their way back
toward the schoolhouse, with the intention,
doubtless, of reporting to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Ben had kept quiet while the redcoats were
talking about the affair, his thought being that
he did not want to be recaptured, but when they
had gone, he realized that he was imprisoned
in a cave, with his hands bound, was practically
helpless, and would likely have to remain there
a prisoner and die of starvation and thirst. He
shuddered, and a cold perspiration broke out
over his body.</p>

<p>He wished, now, that he had called out to the
redcoats. He would have been again made a
prisoner, true, but he would have had the hope
of getting away later on, while as the matter
stood now, he did not see that he had any chance
whatever to escape with his life.</p>

<p>Imprisoned in a cave, the entrance to which
was covered several inches thick with earth, and
with his arms bound, how could he hope to make
his escape? A feeling of despair took hold of
him.</p>

<h1 id='t4826'>CHAPTER XXIII—Dick And Arnold</h1>

<p>When Dick Dare was confronted by General
Arnold and Colonel Riggs, in the
Sprowl home, he realized that it would be useless
to offer resistance. So he simply sat there
quietly, and made no move toward trying to get
away. He was chiding himself, however, for
not having been more careful, and see to it that
Sprowl did not bring some redcoats back with
him.</p>

<p>“Good evening, General Arnold,” said Dick,
quietly. “I wasn’t expecting you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” sarcastically. “But I’m here.
That was a very shrewd plan of yours, to get
Sprowl to secure information for you, and it
might have succeeded, had it not been that I
became suspicious when he told me about you,
and I jumped to the conclusion that likely you
were Dick Dare, so came to investigate.” Then
he turned to Sprowl, who had entered with them,
and said:</p>

<p>“Get a rope and bind his arms.”</p>

<p>Sprowl went to the kitchen and came back
with a piece of rope, and he quickly tied Dick’s
wrists together behind his back.</p>

<p>“Now, Dick Dare, you will answer a few
questions, if you please,” said Arnold.</p>

<p>“What are the questions?” the youth asked.</p>

<p>“First, how many men are there in the rebel
force?”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head. “I won’t answer that
question,” he said.</p>

<p>“You had better,” threateningly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Remember, you are in my power, Dick Dare.
You are a rebel spy, and also I owe you something
for trying to capture me, in New York a
few months ago and again last evening. Answer
my question.”</p>

<p>“I will not give you any information that
might be of use to you in your campaign against
the patriot force,” said Dick, decidedly.</p>

<p>“You had better think well. I have the power
to order you strung up to a tree as a rebel spy.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference,” was the
reply. “I will give you no information, so there
is no use of your asking.”</p>

<p>Arnold glared at Dick angrily for a few
moments, and then said: “Very well. Since
you wish to be stubborn, you may take the consequences.
I think I shall have you strung up,
perhaps tomorrow, Richard Dare!”</p>

<p>Dick made no reply, and Arnold summoned a
couple of soldiers. They entered, took charge
of Dick, and conducted him to a cabin that was
being used as a guard-house. They thrust Dick
into the building and closed and fastened the
door. The youth was left alone in the darkness
to ponder his dubious situation.</p>

<p>He felt that his position was a desperate one,
for he knew that Arnold bore him ill will for the
part he had played in trying to effect the traitor’s
capture in New York; and, too, he was a spy,
and death was usually the fate of spies.</p>

<p>Dick decided that he must manage to make his
escape, but he felt that this would be extremely
difficult, for there were soldiers on guard in
front of the building, and his hands were still
bound.</p>

<p>He worked at his bonds quite a while, however,
in an effort to get his wrists free, but could not
do so, Sprowl having tied the rope very securely.
Finally Dick gave up the attempt, and felt
around till he found a rude couch, upon which
he threw himself, and presently went to sleep.</p>

<p>He did not sleep very soundly, but morning
came at last, and a soldier brought him his
breakfast. His wrists were freed while he ate,
and he put in as much time at the meal as possible,
so as to get the blood to circulating in his
wrists and arms again. He wanted the soldier
to let his arms remain free, but the fellow would
not do it, and bound his wrists again.</p>

<p>Then he went out, closed and again fastened
the door, and Dick sat down on the couch and
tried to figure out some plan of escape, but without
success.</p>

<p>That day passed slowly indeed for Dick Dare,
but evening came at last, and while he was eating
supper the redcoat informed him that an attack
was to be made on the patriot force that evening.</p>

<p>“I wish I could be there to take part in it,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” was the reply. Then the soldier
bound Dick’s wrists again, and withdrew.</p>

<p>So the redcoats were going to make an attack
that evening! Well, Dick hoped that the patriots
would not be taken by surprise. He wished that
he might be able to escape and carry them the
news, but he could not.</p>

<p>He heard the sounds of stirring about by the
redcoats, and knew when they marched out of
the settlement, and then he got up and walked
the floor. He could not sit still, for the thought
that perhaps the British might take the patriots
by surprise was a disquieting one.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and then Dick guessed that
the engagement was probably about to begin.
And just then the faint sound of musketry and
the occasional louder report of cannon came to
his hearing, and then he knew the battle was on.</p>

<p>How he wished that he might be there! But
the wish was vain. He could not escape from
his quarters.</p>

<p>The firing continued for an hour, at least, and
then suddenly, as Dick walked the floor, he saw
one of the wide boards that constituted the floor
of the building he was in, lift slowly, and at the
opening thus made he saw his brother Tom!</p>

<p>“Sh!” whispered Tom. “I have come to
rescue you, Dick.”</p>

<h1 id='t4979'>CHAPTER XXIV—The Rescue</h1>

<p>“Good for you, Tom,” replied Dick,
cautiously. “See if you can get in here,
and free my arms. Then I will be able to help
myself. Wait. I can hold apart the boards with
my feet.” This he proceeded to do.</p>

<p>Tom crawled up through the opening and,
drawing a knife from his pocket, cut the rope
binding Dick’s wrists. Dick stretched his arms,
and then rubbed them vigorously to get the
blood to circulating. While so engaged, he
asked:</p>

<p>“Are there any soldiers on guard outside?”</p>

<p>“There’s a couple around in front,” replied
Tom.</p>

<p>“Then we can slip out the other way, keeping
the building between us and the guards.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Their interest and intention is on the
battle, the sounds of which you have heard, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Did you take any part in the battle?”
inquired Dick.</p>

<p>“No. As soon as the battle began I slipped
away and came here, as I knew it would be a
good time to try to rescue you, as there would be
very few soldiers left here.”</p>

<p>“Right. Well, let’s get out of here quick,
now.”</p>

<p>“Come on. You are bigger than me, but I
guess you can squeeze through this opening and
crawl along under the floor. There isn’t much
room, however.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Tom. I’ll be right at your heels.”
Tom worked his way feet-first down through
the opening, and then disappeared, and after him
went Dick. As Tom had said, there wasn’t
much room under the floor, but Dick managed
to work his way along and finally crawled out
from underneath the floor, and rose to a standing
posture, beside Tom.</p>

<p>“The guards are still around in front, discussing
the battle,” whispered Tom. “Let’s
make a dash for the woods.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit. One of them is coming. Give
me one of your pistols.”</p>

<p>This Tom did and the two crouched closely
to the wall, ready to spring upon the guard immediately
he should appear.</p>

<p>“He is only lighting his pipe,” whispered Tom.
“I hear him striking the flint.”</p>

<p>“Then we can make a break for the woods.
Run your fastest, Tom.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Then they set out on the run, making as little
noise as possible. They had traversed considerably
more than half the distance to the edge of
the forest, when one of the guards who had
walked to the corner of the building, happened
to glance in their direction, and caught sight of
the two youths. He was suspicious at once that
one of them might be his prisoner.</p>

<p>“See if the prisoner has escaped!” he cried
to the other guard. “And be quick!”</p>

<p>Then finding that Dick was gone, both the
guards came rushing around the corner of the
building and started in pursuit of the fugitives.</p>

<p>“Stop!” yelled one. “Stop, or we’ll fire!”</p>

<p>Of course, the patriot youths did not stop, or
pay the least attention to the command. They
kept right on running and were now at the line
of the forest.</p>

<p>Into the woods Dick and Tom dashed just
as the redcoats drew their pistols and fired at the
fugitives. The bullets zipped into the tree trunks
just back of them. Again the redcoats fired,
with the same result.</p>

<p>“Now we are all right,” said Dick. “They
have only two pistols apiece, likely, and so will
not be able to fire again, unless they stop and
reload, in which case we would get so far away
from them that they would never get within
shooting distance again.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Gradually they drew away from the pursuing
redcoats, and finally the pursuers gave up the
chase and turned back. As soon as they noted
this, Dick and Tom slowed their pace to a walk
and took it easy.</p>

<p>They continued onward till they came to the
bank of a creek. The bank was high, and they
noted that at the point where they stood, a
portion of the bank seemed to have caved away
recently. They glanced downward, and saw that
several tons of earth had fallen into the creek
at least thirty feet below, and at a point about
ten or twelve feet down the face of the bank a
ledge that projected three or four feet had
caught and held a ton or so of earth.</p>

<p>It was now almost dark, however, and the
youths, after resting a few moments, were about
to turn and start for the patriot encampment
when to their hearing came a muffled cry for
help.</p>

<p>“Listen!” exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>“Somebody cried ‘help,’” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, but where did the voice come from?”</p>

<p>“It sounded to me as if it came from below
us, somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it seemed to me.”</p>

<p>Dick and Tom dropped down on their knees,
and peered downward, and Dick called out,
loudly:</p>

<p>“Hello, down there! Where are you?”</p>

<p>“In the cave,” came back to their ears, in a
muffled, faint voice. “In behind the earth that
has closed up the entrance to the cave.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is queer!” exclaimed Tom.
“Somebody was in the cave when the bank
caved off, and is a prisoner there.”</p>

<p>“We must get him out, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how will we do it?”</p>

<p>“We must get down there on top of the
ledge, and dig an opening.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I guess we can get down there.
Let’s try it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>They began making their way down the side
of the creek-bank. It was now slightly sloping,
and there were projections and indentations sufficient
to give them foothold, and presently they
stood on the top of the heap of earth that had
lodged on the ledge. They looked to see if they
could see any signs of the entrance, and near
the top of the pile of dirt they found a small
opening, which they judged was near the top
wall of the cave itself. Dick placed his mouth
close to the little opening and called out:</p>

<p>“Hello, in there. Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. And then in an eager
voice came the query: “Is that you, Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick uttered an exclamation of amazement.
“Great Guns, Tom,” he cried. “I believe that
is Ben, in there!”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Tom. “Why, I left
him at the encampment.”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Ben?” called Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes. How did you get here, Dick? I supposed
you were a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I was, but Tom rescued me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” eagerly. “Is Tom with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good! I was hunting him when I got into
this predicament.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon have you out of there, Ben. We’ll
dig from the outside, and you dig from the inside,
and we’ll soon have an opening big enough
for you to crawl through.”</p>

<p>“I can’t dig, Dick. My hands are tied.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Dick. “How did that
happen?”</p>

<p>“I was captured by some redcoats, but managed
to break away and took to my heels. They
chased me, and I fell over the edge of the creek-bank,
and landed on the ledge and rolled into
the cave, and just then the bank caved off and
the dirt closed up the opening. I was just wondering
how I was ever to get out of here. I
guess it is lucky for me that you boys happened
along here.”</p>

<p>“I judge you are right, for you could not have
dug a hole through the dirt with your hands tied.
Tom and I will soon have an opening though
that you can crawl through, however.”</p>

<p>“Good for you.”</p>

<p>Dick and Tom went to work, digging, and in
fifteen or twenty minutes had made a hole
through which Ben managed to crawl, with their
assistance. They cut the rope binding his arms,
and then the three climbed up the bank, to the
level ground, where they sat down to rest a few
minutes, and Ben told his adventure in detail,
and Tom and Dick each told of their experiences.
A little later, all mightily happy, they were on
their way again in the direction of the patriot
encampment.</p>

<h1 id='t5223'>CHAPTER XXV—Beating Arnold</h1>

<p>“I wonder how the battle went?” said
Dick, as they walked onward at a swift
pace.</p>

<p>“We drove them away,” said Ben. “I was
there till the battle was over, and then, missing
Tom, set out to find him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you didn’t leave the encampment till after
the battle, then.”</p>

<p>“No. We got rather the better of the redcoats,
I am certain. They lost a greater number
killed, and a larger number were wounded, than
of our men. And we forced them to retreat.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“I wish I had been there to help fight the redcoats,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Dick. And as the readers of
the Dare Boys books will readily believe, this was
true. But that they were to take part in many
exciting battles before the end of the war will
be seen, as the reader may if he wishes discover
in the next volume of the series, which will be
entitled, “The Dare Boys With General Greene.”</p>

<p>“Was Tim or Fritz wounded?” asked Tom,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Ben. “They were not hurt.”</p>

<p>Presently they reached the encampment, and
were given a cordial welcome by their comrades,
Tim, Fritz and Herbert Miller being delighted.</p>

<p>Dick went to the house occupied by Colonel
Morris and the other officers and made a report,
telling what he knew of the strength of the British
force, and then went back and rejoined his
comrades, and they sat around and talked of the
battle for a while, after which they lay down
and were soon asleep.</p>

<p>This first battle was the beginning of an exciting
and vigorous campaign between Arnold’s
force of redcoats and Tories, and the patriot
force under Colonel Morris.</p>

<p>Each force kept close watch on the other, and
attempts were made to surprise each other and
thus gain a victory, but in the three or four engagements
that took place within the next few
days neither side scored a victory, and the losses
of men, killed and wounded, was about the same.</p>

<p>“We will get the better of Arnold yet, however,”
said Colonel Morris, determinedly, in council
with his officers. “We will keep close watch
on them, and presently we will get a chance to
strike them a blow.”</p>

<p>He kept Dick Dare pretty busy reconnoitering
and spying on the British, and Tom and Ben assisted
Dick quite a good deal in this work. Herbert
Miller, too, was of considerable use, the
four doing a lot of good work in the spying and
reconnoitering line.</p>

<p>One evening, when Dick and Tom were watching
the British encampment, they saw that the
redcoats were breaking camp. They supposed
that the British were going to advance against
the patriot force again and make another attack,
but waited to make sure of this, before carrying
the news to Colonel Morris; but when the British
were ready to march, they set out toward
the east, instead of toward the patriot encampment,
which lay to the northward.</p>

<p>“They are leaving this part of the country!”
exclaimed Tom, excitedly. “They have gotten
enough of fighting our force, and are marching
away.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are right, Tom,” said Dick.
“Well, you hasten to Colonel Morris with the
information. I will follow the British and keep
them under observation.”</p>

<p>“All right, Dick.” Then Tom hastened away,
and Dick set out on the trail of the British. The
redcoats marched perhaps ten or twelve miles,
and then went into camp, and Dick, feeling sure
that they would remain there till morning, made
his way back till he met the patriot force advancing.</p>

<p>Colonel Morris was delighted when he learned
that the British had stopped and gone into camp,
and he decided to go forward and make an attack,
taking the British by surprise, if possible.</p>

<p>Dick guided the patriot force, and a couple of
hours later they were close to the encampment.</p>

<p>The patriots advanced slowly and cautiously,
now, and succeeded in getting almost up to the
sentinel line before they were discovered. Then
at a command from Colonel Morris, they charged
upon the British forces. As they did so, they
opened fire from their muskets, and then were at
close enough quarters to use their bayonets.
There was a hot fight for a little while, and then
the redcoats broke and fled in confusion, as the
patriots fired a couple of pistol-volleys after the
fleeing enemy.</p>

<p>This was a decided victory for the patriots,
for they had killed a score at least of the British,
had wounded thirty or forty, and had lost only
six, killed, and had ten wounded.</p>

<p>This battle was effective in placing a check on
the operations of Arnold in that part of Virginia.
Colonel Morris kept after him, and in several engagements
got the better of him, and Arnold’s
force was not able to do much damage, which
was very satisfactory to the patriot settlers, who
prior to the coming of the patriot force had been
terrorized by Arnold’s army. The plundering
and burning of houses was stopped, and the patriot
people rested in comparative peace.</p>
